      "0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast,\n",
      "2.25 where we discuss science and science-based tools\n",
      "4.92 for everyday life.\n",
      "5.7 [MUSIC PLAYING]\n",
      "9.07 I'm Andrew Huberman,\n",
      "and I'm a professor\n",
      "10.93 of neurobiology and ophthalmology\n",
      "12.94 at Stanford School of Medicine.\n",
      "14.41 Today we are discussing fertility.\n",
      "16.57 We will discuss male fertility and female fertility.\n",
      "19.97 And I should mention that today's discussion is not just\n",
      "23.14 for people who are seeking to conceive children\n",
      "25.45 or who want to know how their children were conceived,\n",
      "27.79 but it's really for everybody.\n",
      "29.47 And I say that because it is the story of all of us.\n",
      "32.95 All of us are here because a specialized set\n",
      "35.8 of cells, called germ cells--\n",
      "38.2 that is the sperm and the egg.\n",
      "39.853 And I'll make it very clear why they're called\n",
      "41.77 germ cells a little bit later.\n",
      "43.02 It has nothing to do with infection.\n",
      "44.62 But it's because a sperm cell and an egg cell arrived at one\n",
      "50.29 another, either in vivo-- inside of our mother-- or in vitro--\n",
      "54.138 so-called in vitro fertilization-- and then\n",
      "55.93 we're implanted into our mother and became us.\n",
      "59.59 And so understanding the process of how\n",
      "62.8 the egg cell and the sperm cell came to be\n",
      "66.13 is really the key to understanding\n",
      "67.93 how that fertilization process came to be.\n",
      "70.263 Now, I know everyone's thinking, I\n",
      "71.68 know how fertilization occurs.\n",
      "73.202 It occurs through sexual intercourse and so on.\n",
      "75.16 And we'll talk a little bit about that.\n",
      "77.05 But I promise you that if you understand\n",
      "79.75 the menstrual cycle--\n",
      "81.28 and the menstrual cycle in today's conversation\n",
      "83.83 can best be thought of as a biological cycle that\n",
      "86.95 occurs in females that allows the potential for fertilization\n",
      "90.94 by the sperm, because that's really what it is,\n",
      "93.04 and it's a beautifully orchestrated process\n",
      "95.08 that I'll describe to you.\n",
      "96.22 And I should say, all people,\n",
      "males and females, should\n",
      "99.79 really understand how the menstrual cycle works,\n",
      "101.95 how it impacts fertilization, but also\n",
      "105.43 how it impacts the brain and body, behavior, psychology,\n",
      "108.46 et cetera.\n",
      "109.12 And we'll also talk about spermatogenesis,\n",
      "112.45 how sperm cells come to be and how they arrive--\n",
      "116.74 that is, how they swim to the egg--\n",
      "118.45 and the incredible interplay between the biology\n",
      "121.81 of the sperm and the biology of the egg\n",
      "125.47 leads to this incredible thing that we call embryogenesis\n",
      "128.77 and the birth of the child and, of course,\n",
      "131.93 the development of that child into an infant, a toddler,\n",
      "136.21 an adolescent, a teen, and an adult.\n",
      "139.6 Today's discussion,\n",
      "again, is not just\n",
      "141.79 for those of you that are seeking to have children.\n",
      "144.55 And I say that because when you look at the data,\n",
      "148.42 you look at the literature on longevity and vitality,\n",
      "151.87 two themes in biology that oftentimes people lump together\n",
      "155.55 but aren't always the same-- for instance,\n",
      "157.3 there are a lot of things that we\n",
      "158.675 can do to increase our vitality that actually\n",
      "161.17 can harm our longevity.\n",
      "163.45 But there are a subset of biological rules and mechanisms\n",
      "167.86 that, when aligned,\n",
      "allow us to maximize both\n",
      "171.1 our vitality and our longevity.\n",
      "174.14 And I think it's fair to say that all of those mechanisms\n",
      "177.43 and tools are housed in the discussion\n",
      "179.65 around maximizing fertility.\n",
      "181.942 And that's true whether or not you're male or female.\n",
      "184.15 In other words, if you want children\n",
      "186.22 or if you don't, if you already have children\n",
      "188.26 or if you don't, understanding how fertility and fertilization\n",
      "192.85 occurs in the brain and body will\n",
      "195.67 allow you to maximize your vitality and longevity.\n",
      "198.76 And of course,\n",
      "today's discussion\n",
      "200.26 will provide an understanding of the biology\n",
      "202.63 and many actionable tools that will also help you conceive\n",
      "205.42 children, if that's your wish.\n",
      "206.98 So of course, as is characteristic of this podcast,\n",
      "210.02 we will discuss science-based tools,\n",
      "212.18 including behavioral tools, both the dos and the don'ts, and we\n",
      "215.86 will discuss nutrition-based tools and supplementation-based\n",
      "219.25 tools and some other practices,\n",
      "including things like\n",
      "222.55 acupuncture, which have quite good data to support them\n",
      "226.09 in terms of improving fertility.\n",
      "227.8 And we will discuss why those certain practices can work.\n",
      "231.76 And we will discuss prescription drugs\n",
      "233.89 that your doctor can prescribe to you if, for instance, you\n",
      "237.82 have a deficit at the level of hormone production\n",
      "240.107 or neurotransmitter production at the level of the brain\n",
      "242.44 or the pituitary gland--\n",
      "243.52 I'll explain what all of those things are soon--\n",
      "245.74 or the gonads, the ovary and the testes in females and males\n",
      "250.03 respectively.\n",
      "252.08 Again, by the end of today's episode,\n",
      "253.64 you will have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools related\n",
      "256.39 to maximizing fertility, and you will\n",
      "258.85 have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools related\n",
      "261.49 to maximizing vitality and longevity.\n",
      "264.76 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize\n",
      "266.532 that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research\n",
      "268.99 roles at Stanford.\n",
      "270.07 It is, however, part of my desire and effort\n",
      "272.29 to bring zero cost to consumer information\n",
      "274.24 about science and science-related tools\n",
      "276.1 to the general public.\n",
      "277.45 In keeping with that theme, I'd like\n",
      "278.95 to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\n",
      "281.42 Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Meats.\n",
      "283.69 Maui Nui Meats, I can confidently say,\n",
      "285.82 are the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available.\n",
      "288.97 Maui Nui he spent nearly a decade\n",
      "290.77 building a USDA-certified wild harvesting system\n",
      "294.1 to help balance invasive deer populations\n",
      "296.29 on the island of Maui.\n",
      "297.76 The solution they built turns the proliferation\n",
      "299.86 of an invasive species into a wide range\n",
      "302.14 of nutrient-dense products, from fresh butcher cuts and organ\n",
      "305.17 meats to bone broth,\n",
      "jerky, and even pet treats.\n",
      "308.22 Their bone broth has an unmatched 25 grams\n",
      "310.59 of protein per 100 calories.\n",
      "312.563 I've talked before on this podcast\n",
      "313.98 and I've had several expert guests come on this podcast\n",
      "316.5 to talk about the fact that most people should aim\n",
      "319.32 to get 1 gram of quality protein per pound\n",
      "322.47 of body weight per day in order to maximize\n",
      "324.78 their health, tissue repair,\n",
      "which includes brain tissue\n",
      "327.45 repair, and, if you're an active exerciser, to support recovery\n",
      "331.23 from exercise.\n",
      "332.82 Maui Nui Meats have an incredible quality protein\n",
      "336.09 to calorie ratio.\n",
      "337.35 And I mentioned the bone broth.\n",
      "339.13 I should also mention that their ground meats and their venison\n",
      "341.82 steaks are absolutely delicious, and their jerky\n",
      "344.13 is absolutely terrific.\n",
      "345.12 In fact, it's the only jerky that I've eaten consistently\n",
      "347.7 that I happen to like consistently over time.\n",
      "349.95 If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,\n",

      "357.18 Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman\n",
      "360.3 to get 20% off your first order.\n",
      "362.4 Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.\n",
      "365.13 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating,\n",
      "367.83 and sleep tracking capacity.\n",
      "369.63 I've talked many times before on this podcast\n",
      "371.73 about the fact that sleep is the fundamental layer\n",
      "374.34 of mental health, physical health, and performance.\n",
      "376.57 Now, one of the key things for getting a great night's sleep\n",
      "379.07 every single night is to optimize the temperature\n",
      "381.48 of your sleeping environment.\n",
      "382.95 Put simply, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep,\n",
      "386.37 your body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.\n",
      "389.34 And waking up, on the other hand,\n",
      "391.12 involves a heating of your body by about 1 to 3 degrees.\n",
      "394.59 With Eight Sleep, you can tune the temperature\n",
      "397.47 of your mattress cover or mattress\n",
      "399.51 to be cooler or hotter, depending on\n",
      "401.855 whether or not you tend to run too hot or too cold,\n",
      "403.98 and you can even vary it across the night\n",
      "405.78 so that you can access the best deep sleep early\n",
      "408.0 in the night, the so-called REM sleep, rapid eye movement\n",
      "410.52 sleep, that's more pronounced in the later half of the night\n",
      "413.02 and in doing so really get your sleep optimized,\n",
      "415.26 not just in terms of duration but in terms of quality\n",
      "417.81 and the overall architecture of your sleep.\n",
      "419.85 This has a profound influence on your alertness, focus, mood,\n",
      "423.143 and many other important factors throughout the day.\n",
      "425.31 If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,\n",
      "426.685 you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman to save\n",
      "429.48 up to $150 off their Pod 3 cover.\n",
      "431.79 Today's episode is also brought to us by Momentous Supplements.\n",
      "434.55 I want to acknowledge that not everybody needs supplements,\n",
      "437.008 and yet many, many people derive tremendous benefit\n",
      "439.47 from proper supplementation.\n",
      "441.37 I would count myself in that group.\n",
      "442.92 There are excellent supplements for improving the depth\n",
      "445.59 and quality of sleep,\n",
      "for improving focus,\n",
      "448.38 and for improving energy and for hormone optimization\n",
      "451.5 and many other factors related to our mental health, physical\n",
      "454.23 health, and performance.\n",
      "455.3 We've partnered with Momentous Supplements\n",
      "457.05 for three important reasons.\n",
      "458.262 First of all,\n",
      "Momentous supplements\n",
      "459.72 are of the very highest quality.\n",
      "461.342 Second of all, they ship internationally,\n",
      "463.05 and we know that many of you reside\n",
      "464.508 outside of the United States.\n",
      "465.81 And third, they focus on single ingredient formulations.\n",
      "468.67 This is very important.\n",
      "469.75 There is a place for blends.\n",
      "471.21 But in most cases, if you're going to develop a supplement\n",
      "474.09 protocol, you want it to be single-ingredient formulations\n",
      "477.03 so that you can adjust the dosages of different things\n",
      "479.28 according to what works and doesn't work for you, which\n",
      "481.572 is essentially impossible to do if you are using\n",
      "483.63 multi-ingredient formulations.\n",
      "485.29 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take\n",
      "487.29 and that we've discussed here on the Huberman Lab podcast,\n",
      "489.707 you can go to livemomentous--\n",
      "spelled O-U-S--\n",
      "491.82 so livemomentous.com/huberman and get 20% off any\n",
      "496.18 supplements.\n",
      "496.68 Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman\n",
      "499.17 to get 20% off.\n",
      "500.52 Let's talk about fertility.\n",
      "501.78 And in doing so, let's take a step back from this word\n",
      "504.12 \"fertility\" and ask, what is fertility and fertilization\n",
      "507.45 really all about?\n",
      "508.69 Well, the obvious answer is that it's about producing offspring.\n",
      "511.77 But more importantly, it's about producing offspring\n",
      "514.95 that contain the genetic components of both parents\n",
      "518.61 and indeed contain half of the genes from one parent\n",
      "521.82 and half of the genes from another parent.\n",
      "523.74 Now, there are two general types of cells in the body.\n",
      "526.73 The most common types of cells in the body\n",
      "528.48 are called somatic cells.\n",
      "529.57 So these would be all the cells in your body\n",
      "531.403 except the egg in females and the sperm in males.\n",
      "534.9 The egg in females and the sperm males\n",
      "537.33 are part of what's called the germline.\n",
      "539.04 And again, it has nothing to do with infection.\n",
      "540.998 It's just that the cells of the germline have genes that cannot\n",
      "545.34 be modified by the behavior of the individual that houses\n",
      "549.3 those genes.\n",
      "550.2 What do I mean by that?\n",
      "551.26 Well, if I were to tell you that by exercising you can improve\n",
      "554.31 mitochondrial function,\n",
      "you can change hormones\n",
      "558.54 by reducing stress,\n",
      "you can reduce cortisol\n",
      "560.91 by hitting puberty,\n",
      "for instance, you\n",
      "564.36 will have the secretion of hormones that then change\n",
      "566.845 gene expression in other cells, leading\n",
      "568.47 to the development of body hair, facial hair,\n",
      "571.14 deepening the voice,\n",
      "breast growth, et cetera,\n",
      "573.925 you'd say, OK, great.\n",
      "574.8 Yeah, that all makes perfect sense.\n",
      "576.91 But that's all occurring in the so-called somatic cells.\n",
      "579.6 The germ cells or the germline cells--\n",
      "581.91 that is, the egg and the sperm--\n",
      "583.98 are a very unique and protected set\n",
      "586.26 of cells that are generated in a particular way\n",
      "589.47 and whose genetic components are not modifiable by experience.\n",
      "595.272 And when you take a step back and you think about it,\n",
      "597.48 you say, oh, that's right.\n",
      "598.563 There's no reason to think that exercising\n",
      "600.99 will make the children that you have not yet had stronger.\n",
      "605.02 And you say, of course not.\n",
      "606.27 Well, why is that?\n",
      "607.09 Well, that's because there is a barrier\n",
      "609.27 between the genes of the germline cells and behaviors.\n",
      "614.01 They cannot be modified by behaviors and the various\n",
      "616.62 things that you do in your lifetime.\n",
      "618.39 Now, I suppose there's an exception\n",
      "619.92 in the negative direction.\n",
      "621.96 And what I'm referring to here is if you were to, say,\n",
      "624.3 be exposed to a chemical that could mutate the DNA\n",
      "627.15 of your egg or sperm or if you were to fertilize an embryo\n",
      "632.01 in a certain way or at a certain stage of life that it got\n",
      "635.07 an extra chromosome,\n",
      "for instance--\n",
      "636.528 we'll talk about this a little bit later--\n",
      "638.278 well, then, of course,\n",
      "you could end up\n",
      "639.96 with offspring that have modified\n",
      "642.24 DNA that don't faithfully represent half of the genes\n",
      "645.75 from mom and half of the genes from dad.\n",
      "648.21 But that's not the same as specific behaviors\n",
      "651.39 modifying the genes of those cells--\n",
      "653.55 the sperm and the egg cells--\n",
      "655.32 in a way that improves the offspring.\n",
      "658.71 So the key first thing to understand today\n",
      "660.613 is that there's a distinction between somatic cells, which\n",
      "663.03 is the vast majority of cells in your body,\n",
      "664.44 and the so-called germline cells, which\n",
      "665.79 are the egg and the sperm.\n",
      "666.873 The egg and the sperm are these highly protected populations\n",
      "669.69 of cells that, in females, actually come\n",
      "673.41 to be during embryogenesis.\n",
      "676.11 So for all females out there, you\n",
      "678.84 generate what today I'm going to refer to as a vault of cells.\n",
      "682.44 You have a vault of eggs that are your germline.\n",
      "686.73 Those eggs all contain all the chromosomes of your DNA.\n",
      "692.08 So it's going to be-- as most of you\n",
      "693.62 know, there are 23 chromosomes,\n",
      "and chromosomes exist in pairs.\n",
      "697.45 So the way to think about this is each pair is one strand,\n",
      "700.53 and you have 22\n",
      "so-called autosomes,\n",
      "702.66 and then you have one sex chromosome.\n",
      "704.4 The sex chromosome will be either X or Y. So in a female,\n",
      "707.38 they have two X chromosomes.\n",
      "708.76 So in each one of the eggs that a woman has\n",
      "711.12 and that she's had since she was an embryo\n",
      "713.64 and that's contained in this vault,\n",
      "715.5 those eggs are, of course, going to be very immature at birth.\n",
      "719.52 She hasn't undergone puberty yet.\n",
      "720.96 And certainly, as an embryo,\n",
      "she hasn't undergone puberty.\n",
      "723.51 And those cells are going to contain\n",

      "732.1 The chromosomes are essentially the wrapped-up DNA\n",
      "736.32 that contains all the genetic information\n",
      "738.33 to create any cell type in the body\n",
      "740.19 and actually to create an entirely new individual.\n",
      "743.41 Now, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, 22 of which\n",
      "746.76 are called autosomes.\n",
      "748.433 If that doesn't make sense to you,\n",
      "749.85 just remember, autosome,\n",
      "OK, there's 22 of them.\n",
      "752.32 And then there's one so-called sex chromosome.\n",
      "754.5 The sex chromosomes are either X or Y. But this is a female,\n",
      "757.99 so she's going to have\n",

      "767.16 I'll make it very clear how this all relates to fertility\n",
      "770.13 and how it relates to chromosomal segregation\n",
      "773.01 and a bunch of things that I think maybe you've heard of\n",
      "775.59 and that perhaps were opaque to you.\n",
      "777.945 But I promise to make them clear.\n",
      "779.32 But just understand that,\n",
      "within each of those eggs,\n",
      "781.487 they have 23 pairs of chromosomes.\n",
      "783.57 And for those of you that like nomenclature,\n",
      "786.78 I'll tell you that those cells are considered diploid.\n",
      "789.42 They're called the diploid, and that\n",
      "791.16 means that they have 23\n",
      "pairs of chromosomes,\n",
      "794.01 as distinguished from cells that are\n",
      "796.89 haploid where there's only one set of those 23 chromosomes.\n",

      "826.89 and we will be careful to distinguish follicles\n",
      "830.16 from eggs.\n",
      "830.85 They're often talked about interchangeably, online\n",
      "833.43 and elsewhere and even by fertility docs and OB/GYNs.\n",

      "840.33 themselves, which are cells.\n",
      "842.64 Now, the goal of fertilization is\n",
      "845.58 to bring that egg cell into close enough proximity\n",
      "848.31 that it can be fertilized by a single sperm cell.\n",
      "852.3 And that sperm cell will bring 23 chromosomes, as well,\n",
      "856.89 that include--\n",

      "862.38 chromosome.\n",
      "863.17 And in the male,\n",
      "that sex chromosome\n",
      "864.87 can either be an X chromosome,\n",
      "which then would give rise\n",
      "868.91 to female offspring, or a Y chromosome, which would\n",

      "873.92 And today we're not talking about sexual differentiation.\n",
      "876.62 That's a topic of a previous and yet another future episode.\n",
      "879.44 But just to give you a sense of how X chromosomes and Y\n",
      "883.22 chromosomes can actually accomplish\n",
      "885.11 that sexual differentiation,\n",
      "both of body and brain.\n",
      "889.73 I'll just mention in two sentences that, for instance,\n",
      "892.8 if there's a Y chromosome as opposed to an X chromosome,\n",
      "895.58 that Y chromosome contains genes that suppress, for instance,\n",
      "899.76 the development of female genitalia\n",
      "901.88 and thereby give rise to male genitalia.\n",
      "905.458 So rather than the formation of a clitoris,\n",
      "907.25 it's the formation of a penis.\n",
      "908.902 And rather than the formation of ovaries,\n",
      "910.61 the formation of a testes.\n",
      "912.14 So that's more directed towards sexual differentiation.\n",
      "914.438 We're not going to get into that right now.\n",
      "916.23 We'll get into that in a future episode.\n",
      "918.05 But even if you're only tracking about 10%\n",
      "921.56 of what I'm saying right now,\n",
      "I promise you're doing great.\n",
      "924.15 If you're tracking more than 10%, well,\n",
      "925.82 then you're doing terrifically well,\n",
      "927.32 because the essence of fertility and fertilization is to bring\n",
      "930.44 together that haploid cell that is the sperm that only has 23\n",
      "937.34 chromosomes-- but not pairs of chromosomes\n",
      "940.55 because that's the DNA from dad--\n",
      "942.47 together with the egg,\n",
      "which, as I told you already,\n",
      "945.95 has 23 pairs of chromosomes.\n",
      "947.97 So part of the fertilization process\n",
      "950.57 has to be to get rid of one half of those 23 pairs\n",
      "954.56 in the female.\n",
      "955.25 You got to get rid of it, and you\n",
      "958.36 have to get the egg and the sperm in proximity\n",
      "960.82 so that the egg can potentially be fertilized\n",
      "963.4 by the sperm bringing the DNA, the 23\n",
      "967.24 single strands of chromosomes from dad,\n",
      "971.53 into a cell that has 23\n",
      "single strands from mom.\n",
      "976.13 So I realize I'm probably being a little bit repetitive here,\n",
      "978.79 but I want everyone to understand this\n",
      "981.34 because it really frames up fertility and reproduction\n",
      "984.55 in the proper way.\n",
      "986.77 We've got a cell from mom, the egg, which\n",
      "989.65 has 23 pairs of chromosomes.\n",
      "992.87 We need to get rid of one set of those pairs\n",
      "995.86 so that there's only 23 chromosomes.\n",
      "997.75 We need to get rid of half of those chromosomes.\n",
      "1000.3 And then we need to bring that cell together physically\n",
      "1003.54 with the sperm cell that contains the 23\n",
      "1008.13 chromosomal strands from dad.\n",
      "1010.562 And we need to bring those together so that you\n",
      "1012.52 get 23 chromosomal pairs from dad\n",
      "1014.86 and 23 chromosomal pairs from mom.\n",
      "1018.01 And in doing so, you create a cell, which\n",
      "1022.21 then becomes multiple cells.\n",
      "1023.62 That's going to be the developing embryo that\n",
      "1025.569 has half the genes from mom and half the genes from dad.\n",
      "1028.089 So I hope that's clear.\n",
      "1029.56 That is the biological logic, which I realize\n",
      "1032.342 is a bit of a tongue twister.\n",
      "1033.55 But forgive me.\n",
      "1034.96 It is the most accurate way to describe this process.\n",
      "1037.72 We're trying to bring together the 23 single strands\n",
      "1041.589 of chromosomes from dad and the 23\n",
      "1043.48 single strands of chromosomes from mom into the same cell.\n",
      "1047.95 Now, that requires a literal physical contact\n",
      "1051.85 and pairing of the two cells.\n",
      "1053.38 But as I mentioned before,\n",
      "all these eggs in mom\n",
      "1057.76 are sitting in a vault, and they're very, very immature.\n",
      "1060.58 So the ovulatory cycle and the menstrual cycle\n",
      "1064.45 are really about first eliminating\n",
      "1067.06 half of the chromosomal pairs in that 23 sets of chromosomes\n",
      "1071.86 and not getting rid of,\n",
      "for instance, half--\n",
      "1074.71 just going 1 to 11 or 12 to 23.\n",
      "1079.42 That's not the goal.\n",
      "1080.39 The goal is to have chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\n",
      "1082.84 6, all the way up to\n",
      "23, but only to have\n",
      "1085.6 half of the chromosomes there and to bring that cell together\n",
      "1089.23 with the sperm cell,\n",
      "physically, then allow\n",
      "1091.99 them to fuse and allow the chromosomes from dad\n",
      "1094.99 and the chromosomes from mom to fuse within a single cell\n",
      "1098.38 and duplicate into cells that contain half of the chromosomes\n",
      "1102.07 from dad and half of the chromosomes from mom.\n",
      "1104.29 That's what the ovulatory and menstrual cycle\n",
      "1106.42 are really all about.\n",
      "1107.752 So when thinking about it that way,\n",
      "1109.21 I'd like to just initiate the discussion by focusing first\n",
      "1112.09 on the female component,\n",
      "or the egg component,\n",
      "1115.78 of fertility and fertilization.\n",
      "1119.65 As I mentioned before, a female has all the eggs,\n",
      "1123.31 albeit very immature eggs, that she's going to have at the time\n",
      "1126.82 that she's born.\n",
      "1128.32 Now, puberty will happen at some point\n",
      "1132.34 and will allow the ovulatory and the menstrual cycle\n",
      "1135.7 to commence.\n",
      "1137.095 Now, one question that you perhaps are asking\n",
      "1138.97 is, what controls the onset of puberty?\n",
      "1141.1 And there are a number of different results,\n",
      "1144.053 each of which could be an entire episode\n",
      "1145.72 of a podcast on its own.\n",
      "1147.04 But I'll just highlight a few things\n",
      "1148.54 that we know about the onset of menses or menstruation,\n",
      "1152.77 or it's sometimes also called a menarche.\n",
      "1154.942 One thing that you'll notice about today's discussion\n",
      "1157.15 is that if you were to take any number of your notes\n",
      "1159.46 online and put them into a search function\n",
      "1162.28 that you would see a lot of different language used\n",
      "1164.68 for the same thing.\n",
      "1165.65 So for instance,\n",
      "some people will\n",
      "1166.45 talk about the egg and the follicle as the same thing,\n",
      "1168.73 even though they are not.\n",
      "1169.96 I'll explain the difference soon.\n",
      "1171.335 Some people will talk about menses or menstruation\n",
      "1173.5 or menarche as the exact same thing.\n",
      "1175.19 And in fact, they are not the exact same thing,\n",
      "1177.22 but oftentimes these words are used interchangeably.\n",
      "1180.34 I'll do my best today to not overload you with nomenclature\n",
      "1183.22 but rather to use the most commonly used terms\n",
      "1186.97 for the different aspects of fertility and fertilization.\n",
      "1189.94 But when it comes to the onset of puberty,\n",
      "1192.7 first of all, most of you have probably\n",
      "1195.01 heard that the onset of puberty is\n",
      "1198.64 happening much earlier in females now\n",
      "1200.89 than it was some years ago.\n",
      "1202.31 And in fact, that is the case.\n",
      "1204.13 And I'll talk about some statistics related\n",
      "1206.05 to this which are pretty striking\n",
      "1208.06 but don't necessarily point to anything detrimental.\n",
      "1211.74 It doesn't necessarily mean that something bad is happening.\n",
      "1214.24 What do we know for sure?\n",
      "1215.38 Well, we know that there are a number\n",
      "1217.75 of signals that come both through the brain\n",
      "1220.3 and through the body--\n",
      "1222.37 and more likely both-- in order to control the onset of puberty\n",
      "1225.34 in females.\n",
      "1226.27 A couple of examples-- the first is a mechanistic one.\n",
      "1229.3 We know, for instance,\n",
      "that the entire process\n",
      "1233.35 of the ovulatory menstrual cycle is initiated from the brain.\n",
      "1236.398 We're going to get into this in a lot\n",
      "1237.94 more detail in a few minutes.\n",
      "1239.148 But there's a certain number of hormones and neurotransmitters\n",
      "1242.86 that are communicated from the brain,\n",
      "1245.2 a structure called the hypothalamus,\n",
      "1247.01 which roughly sits above the roof of your mouth,\n",
      "1249.7 and that communicates with a gland, an endocrine\n",
      "1253.24 or hormone-releasing gland called the pituitary gland.\n",
      "1256.85 The pituitary gland looks like a stalk that essentially\n",
      "1261.58 extends out of the brain.\n",
      "1263.06 It's also located not far from the roof of your mouth.\n",
      "1266.14 And that has two sort of small marble\n",
      "1268.9 or grape-sized protrusions,\n",
      "the anterior pituitary\n",
      "1273.863 and the posterior pituitary.\n",
      "1275.03 And they release different hormones into the bloodstream.\n",
      "1278.29 Puberty is in part controlled by the fact\n",
      "1281.59 that, up until puberty, there are\n",
      "1284.56 neurons in the hypothalamus that release\n",
      "1286.54 a neurotransmitter called GABA, which is inhibitory,\n",
      "1288.97 and that prevents the neurons in the hypothalamus\n",
      "1292.15 from releasing a very important hormone called\n",
      "1296.35 gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH.\n",
      "1299.42 So the first thing I'd really like everyone\n",
      "1301.24 to know and commit to memory today is very easy--\n",
      "1303.49 GnRH stands for gonadotropin-releasing hormone.\n",
      "1306.95 This comes from the brain and will\n",
      "1308.89 communicate to the pituitary to release certain hormones.\n",
      "1312.37 Prior to puberty, in both males and females,\n",
      "1316.33 there are neurons in the brain that are actively suppressing\n",
      "1319.54 the neurons that release GnRH.\n",
      "1321.49 It's like no puberty,\n",
      "no puberty, no puberty.\n",
      "1323.925 You can't have puberty.\n",
      "1324.942 You can't have puberty.\n",
      "1325.9 And in fact, those cells are releasing this neurotransmitter\n",
      "1329.85 called GABA because it's inhibitory.\n",
      "1331.35 It prevents the firing of those neurons.\n",
      "1333.8 So puberty is actively suppressed up\n",
      "1335.95 until a certain point.\n",
      "1337.06 It's also actively suppressed,\n",
      "at least in some species and we\n",
      "1340.21 think at least partially in humans, by the tonic release--\n",
      "1344.35 that means the ongoing release, around the clock--\n",
      "1347.05 of a hormone called melatonin.\n",
      "1349.48 Later in life-- in fact, after puberty--\n",
      "1352.54 melatonin will be secreted only in the dark phase of each night\n",
      "1357.1 and around the time that one goes to sleep.\n",
      "1359.27 But in children and in particular\n",
      "1361.96 in children prior to puberty, melatonin\n",
      "1364.0 is released more or less constantly.\n",
      "1366.67 Now, melatonin isn't the only source\n",
      "1368.737 of suppression of puberty.\n",
      "1369.82 It's also these neural mechanisms involving GABA.\n",
      "1373.15 But it is certainly a great candidate for one\n",
      "1376.39 of the reasons why puberty doesn't generally\n",
      "1378.4 tend to happen at,\n",
      "say, age four age five.\n",
      "1380.53 That would be very unusual.\n",
      "1383.74 Another component of suppression of puberty\n",
      "1387.49 is that typically in children they have relatively low body\n",
      "1391.09 fat stores.\n",
      "1391.85 Why is this important?\n",
      "1392.81 Well, we know that one of the things that can trigger\n",
      "1395.86 the onset of puberty-- in particular in females--\n",
      "1398.77 is that when enough body fat accumulates,\n",
      "1402.25 that body fat releases a hormone called leptin,\n",
      "1405.64 and that hormone leptin travels in the bloodstream,\n",
      "1408.55 across the blood-brain barrier,\n",
      "and goes to the hypothalamus\n",
      "1411.31 and can trigger the onset of puberty\n",
      "1412.99 by activating the neurons that release\n",
      "1415.99 gonadotropin-releasing hormone.\n",
      "1417.71 So many people believe that one of the reasons that puberty\n",
      "1421.21 is happening earlier and earlier in females\n",
      "1423.82 is because of the accumulation of more body fat at younger\n",
      "1428.05 ages than was observed 30 or\n",
      "40 and certainly 100 years ago.\n",
      "1432.79 Now, I can already imagine a number of people are thinking,\n",
      "1435.7 oh, this must relate to the obesity crisis.\n",
      "1438.05 And indeed, there is a crisis of obesity.\n",
      "1439.81 Obesity is something that is causing all sorts of problems\n",
      "1444.94 with people's health at various levels, brain and body,\n",
      "1447.94 and that is far more frequent today\n",
      "1449.74 than it was even 20 years ago.\n",
      "1451.76 So it is indeed a crisis because it\n",
      "1453.55 has enormous detrimental effects for so many aspects\n",
      "1456.79 of brain and body health and longevity.\n",
      "1460.27 But this whole process of thinking about body fat\n",
      "1462.807 signaling leptin to the hypothalamus and the onset\n",
      "1464.89 of puberty doesn't necessarily have\n",
      "1467.24 to do with the obesity crisis.\n",
      "1468.49 It might relate, but it could also relate to, for instance,\n",
      "1471.52 improved nutrition,\n",
      "which is allowing body\n",
      "1473.83 fat stores to accumulate maybe not to the level of obesity\n",
      "1476.89 but to accumulate earlier and at younger ages\n",
      "1480.1 in females, which is then causing\n",
      "1482.23 earlier puberty in females.\n",
      "1484.39 To just highlight how that might be possible,\n",
      "1486.67 I want to review some data that talk about the onset of menses,\n",
      "1490.63 menstruation--\n",
      "that is, puberty--\n",
      "1492.67 in females according to country and according\n",
      "1495.7 to age over the last\n",
      "100 or more years.\n",
      "1499.01 So what are the general trends in terms\n",
      "1500.752 of the onset of puberty in females?\n",
      "1502.21 Well, that's an easy one to answer.\n",
      "1504.94 Over the last 100 years or so, the onset of puberty\n",

      "1550.21 the essence of all of these findings\n",
      "1552.43 is that puberty is happening much, much earlier\n",
      "1554.89 with each passing decade.\n",
      "1556.15 So for instance, in the United States, around 1900 or 1903,\n",
      "1562.28 the average age of menarche,\n",
      "the onset of puberty, in females\n",
      "1566.14 was about 14 years old, whereas in 1990, the average age is 11.\n",

      "1577.61 Now, of course,\n",
      "these are averages.\n",
      "1579.08 So there will be exceptions.\n",
      "1580.55 There's a distribution of data.\n",
      "1582.55 Today, still, there will be young females who\n",

      "1588.28 and others who will undergo puberty at age 13, 14, maybe\n",
      "1591.67 even 16 or 17.\n",
      "1593.44 However, if we look at, for instance,\n",
      "1596.06 the data from Norway, which dates back quite far-- they\n",
      "1598.57 have excellent record-keeping--\n",
      "to 1850, what we see\n",
      "1602.14 is that the average age of the onset of female puberty in 1850\n",
      "1606.73 in Norway was 17 years old, whereas in 1970, it's\n",
      "1612.33 13 years old.\n",
      "1613.69 So this is a dramatic acceleration\n",
      "1616.11 of the onset of puberty.\n",
      "1617.357 And you see a similar trend in other countries, as well.\n",
      "1619.69 So if we were to look,\n",

      "1627.81 But the average age of the onset of puberty in the UK in 1940\n",
      "1631.98 was 13 and 1/2 years old.\n",
      "1633.69 Again, this is just for females.\n",
      "1635.52 And in 1970, it was closer to 13,\n",
      "1638.46 with a trend towards declining even further.\n",

      "1668.91 believe it or not-- or perhaps not surprisingly.\n",
      "1671.13 And maybe it has to do with the obesity crisis.\n",
      "1673.57 And yet I don't think we can conclude that at all.\n",
      "1676.2 Something is happening, however.\n",
      "1678.33 It could be increased body fat stores\n",
      "1681.18 due to overeating and obesity.\n",

      "1704.04 are very, very apparent.\n",
      "1705.63 And as a final point, I should also\n",

      "1794.46 by her biological systems.\n",
      "1796.71 That-- I don't want to say protects\n",
      "1798.99 because it kind of skews the valence of the conversation,\n",
      "1802.14 but that offsets or buffers the otherwise observed effect,\n",

      "1811.86 if it's present often enough or perhaps intensely enough,\n",
      "1814.92 that it can trigger the onset of puberty in that female.\n",
      "1817.44 In other words, the scent of a male that is not the father\n",
      "1822.09 and we think also that is not biologically related to her\n",
      "1825.12 can trigger earlier onset of puberty.\n",
      "1827.85 And that effect can at least be partially buffered\n",
      "1832.35 by her being in the presence of the scent\n",
      "1836.04 from her biological father.\n",
      "1837.99 Now, some of you are probably already leaping\n",

      "2001.367 and make those cells take on different properties.\n",
      "2003.45 So they can mature those cells.\n",
      "2004.742 So for instance, a good example of this outside\n",
      "2007.31 of the context we've been talking about\n",
      "2008.99 is the hormone testosterone can travel to the hair follicle\n",

      "2017.12 A different hormone,\n",
      "estrogen, can\n",
      "2019.19 travel to the cells of the breast tissue\n",

      "2050.94 So you'll never forget prolactin.\n",
      "2053.96 The point being that different hormones\n",
      "2056.09 have different effects on different cells,\n",
      "2057.889 depending on what cells those are.\n",
      "2059.366 Estrogen or estradiol is going to have different effects\n",

      "2087.82 of biological implications.\n",
      "2089.69 So let's focus now on what happens when\n",
      "2092.08 LH and FSH arrive at the ovary.\n",
      "2094.989 And let's assume now that we're talking about a female who\n",

      "2198.068 what this is all about.\n",
      "2199.1 This is all about creating the potential for an egg\n",
      "2202.39 to be fertilized,\n",
      "and that egg needs\n",
      "2204.22 to have half of the chromosomal pairs, so no pairs,\n",
      "2208.18 but it's got to have 23\n",
      "chromosomes just from mom.\n",
      "2211.12 And we need to position that egg so\n",
      "2213.82 that the egg can be met by the sperm\n",
      "2216.82 and that sperm can penetrate that egg\n",
      "2219.01 and donate its 23 individual strands of chromosomes\n",
      "2224.2 to that egg so that you can bring together the DNA of dad\n",
      "2227.95 and the DNA of mom.\n",
      "2229.3 So the obligatory menstrual cycle\n",
      "2231.46 occurs when luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating\n",
      "2236.08 hormone have been released.\n",
      "2238.12 And the ovulatory/menstrual cycle--\n",
      "2241.81 and here I have to kind of pick what I want to call it.\n",
      "2244.683 I guess to be really accurate,\n",
      "we would just call it\n",
      "2246.85 the female reproductive cycle,\n",
      "but that includes underneath it\n",
      "2250.545 both the menstrual cycle,\n",
      "as it's sometimes called,\n",
      "2252.67 and the ovulatory cycle.\n",
      "2254.0 So you decide.\n",
      "2254.95 I'm going to interchangeably discuss the ovulatory cycle\n",
      "2258.25 and the menstrual cycle.\n",
      "2259.47 The problem is, when you say menstruation,\n",
      "2261.22 people often think about just the period, the shedding\n",
      "2263.59 of the uterine lining when fertilization has not occurred.\n",
      "2266.63 So if I start saying ovulatory cycle,\n",
      "2269.35 just keep in mind I'm referring to the entire thing.\n",

      "2564.72 It's growing.\n",
      "2565.65 It's maturing.\n",

      "follicle-stimulating hormone,\n",
      "2587.88 triggering the maturation of some eggs\n",

      "2602.76 Just a beautiful symphony of expression of different genes\n",
      "2606.66 and different hormones to make everything\n",
      "2608.55 work as optimally as possible.\n",
      "2610.17 So as these different follicles mature, somehow--\n",
      "2613.86 and we still don't know exactly how--\n",
      "2615.96 one of those follicles containing an egg\n",
      "2618.9 gets selected.\n",
      "2620.79 It's either because it matures the fastest\n",
      "2622.95 or there's something about it that\n",
      "2625.92 is still not completely understood\n",
      "2628.35 that allows it to be selected.\n",
      "2630.42 And all the other follicles that are maturing\n",
      "2633.33 degenerate and die.\n",
      "2634.86 And they're gone.\n",
      "2635.61 They don't go back into the ovarian reserve.\n",
      "2637.95 They are now depleted from that bank account\n",
      "2641.19 that is the ovarian reserve.\n",
      "2643.23 They die off.\n",
      "2644.7 But that single egg that, keep in mind,\n",
      "2648.42 contains 23 pairs of chromosomes--\n",
      "2651.63 we haven't gotten rid of one half of those 23\n",
      "2655.14 sets of chromosomes yet.\n",
      "2656.73 But that one will continue to mature.\n",
      "2658.8 And then, at some point, that egg\n",
      "2663.15 will start to undergo a process in which those chromosomes are\n",
      "2668.04 pulled apart by little components\n",
      "2671.4 within the egg called spindles.\n",
      "2673.53 They literally have a physical pulling\n",
      "2675.48 of the chromosomes apart.\n",
      "2676.57 So now those 23 pairs are no longer attached to one another\n",
      "2680.26 at the middle like they were before,\n",
      "2681.76 like two beads of strings--\n",
      "2684.28 or I should say,\n",
      "23 short strands\n",
      "2687.52 of beads that were at once connected to one another\n",
      "2691.6 now are pulled apart so that you have\n",
      "2693.34 23 chromosomes on each side, but they're\n",
      "2696.4 pulled apart from one another.\n",
      "2698.9 So that diploid cell is now starting\n",
      "2702.76 to become a cell in which half of the chromosomes,\n",
      "2705.86 half of those 23\n",
      "pairs, are physically\n",
      "2708.61 pulled away from the others.\n",
      "2710.11 And then the egg actually starts to form its own\n",
      "2713.5 what we call an involution of membrane\n",
      "2715.12 around those 23 pairs, one set of them, and encapsulates them.\n",
      "2720.49 So you sort of got an egg with two parts\n",
      "2722.65 where the two sets of chromosomes,\n",
      "2724.237 two sets of 23 chromosomes,\n",
      "are now separate\n",
      "2726.07 from one another inside of the egg.\n",
      "2728.17 And then one of those actually gets ejected from the egg,\n",
      "2732.01 and the name of that thing that gets ejected--\n",
      "2734.35 it's sort of like a little Hubble pod is how I imagine it,\n",
      "2737.29 you know, from Star Wars or from any kind of Space Odyssey movie\n",
      "2741.22 where some thing is ready to happen.\n",
      "2743.11 A little Hubble pod shoots out of the ship.\n",
      "2745.06 Well, that 23 pairs is now ejected from the egg.\n",
      "2749.71 It's called the polar body.\n",
      "2750.88 And that's going to degenerate.\n",
      "2752.41 It's going to go away.\n",
      "2753.67 And in doing so, take the egg cell, which was once\n",
      "2756.73 diploid-- it had 23 pairs of chromosomes-- and making\n",
      "2759.67 it haploid.\n",
      "2761.02 And now what you've got,\n",
      "in ideal circumstances,\n",
      "2764.23 is a beautifully pristine egg that was selected for\n",
      "2767.5 and has 23 single strands of chromosomes, 22 autosomes\n",
      "2771.702 and one sex chromosome.\n",
      "2772.66 And that sex chromosome is going to be an X chromosome\n",
      "2775.45 almost with certainty,\n",
      "because female--\n",
      "2779.29 mother-- is creating that egg.\n",
      "2782.54 So then the egg that contains just the appropriate 23\n",
      "2786.64 single-stranded chromosomes is going\n",
      "2789.25 to fuse with the wall of the ovary, and that egg\n",
      "2791.53 will be released and will travel into the Fallopian tube.\n",
      "2796.0 Now, we'll get back to that egg in a few moments.\n",
      "2798.29 But that process, which represents the first half\n",
      "2800.65 of the ovulatory menstrual cycle, again,\n",
      "2802.45 was triggered by FSH and to some extent luteinizing hormone.\n",
      "2805.88 But it is the ongoing maturation of that egg which also causes\n",
      "2811.48 the production of estrogen,\n",
      "which allows that whole process\n",
      "2815.51 to occur.\n",
      "2816.01 And you could say, why?\n",
      "2817.22 Well, the answer to the why is a very important\n",
      "2819.767 biological principle that we are going\n",
      "2821.35 to return to in a number of different contexts today,\n",
      "2823.558 both as reference to female and male fertility.\n",
      "2828.04 And the principle is a so-called negative feedback.\n",
      "2832.55 So when estrogen is present at relatively low levels\n",
      "2835.72 in females in the ovary, as it is\n",
      "2839.08 during the development of these eggs, some of that estrogen,\n",
      "2842.47 of course, is going to exit the ovary.\n",
      "2844.857 It's going to go into the bloodstream.\n",
      "2846.44 And it's going to travel back to the pituitary.\n",
      "2849.81 Now, the pituitary can release things\n",
      "2852.078 like follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing\n",
      "2854.12 hormone.\n",
      "2854.72 But the way I'd like you to think\n",
      "2856.4 about the pituitary for sake of feedback loops\n",
      "2858.86 is that it's sort of like a thermometer\n",
      "2861.02 that you would put into a pool,\n",
      "like a backyard pool, that\n",
      "2864.89 is attached to the heater.\n",
      "2866.39 And for instance, if you were to put a thermometer into a pool\n",
      "2870.38 that you would like to keep at 70 degrees\n",
      "2872.9 and the temperature of that pool is 60 degrees,\n",
      "2875.6 well, then that thermometer ought\n",
      "2877.34 to trigger some sort of mechanism\n",
      "2879.56 where the pool would heat up until the temperature\n",
      "2881.93 of the pool hit 70\n",
      "degrees, and then it\n",
      "2884.12 should trigger that thermometer to turn off the heating system.\n",
      "2886.903 That's kind of a negative feedback\n",
      "2888.32 system that would keep the temperature more\n",
      "2890.112 or less correct.\n",
      "2891.65 That's a lot of the way that the system's related to estrogen\n",
      "2894.78 and also testosterone and these different things\n",
      "2896.78 like luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone\n",
      "2899.155 work as well.\n",
      "2900.02 Typically, when the level of a hormone is too high,\n",
      "2904.35 then it shuts down the production\n",
      "2906.02 of the hormones that would trigger further production\n",
      "2908.3 of that hormone.\n",
      "2908.84 I know that's a mouthful.\n",
      "2909.68 It's a lot to think about.\n",
      "2910.74 And some of you are probably thinking, whoa,\n",
      "2911.82 I'm getting dizzy now with biology.\n",
      "2913.46 But I promise you, you can understand this.\n",
      "2915.35 In females, when estrogen is relatively low--\n",
      "2918.36 but not zero but is relatively low\n",
      "2920.06 during that first follicular half of the ovulatory cycle--\n",
      "2923.84 it actually triggers negative feedback on LH and FSH\n",
      "2927.26 so that not too much is produced.\n",
      "2929.06 But then just prior to ovulation,\n",
      "2931.61 the levels of estrogen and the levels of some other hormones\n",
      "2934.79 from those eggs--\n",
      "2936.68 you have the eggs producing estrogen themselves--\n",
      "2939.35 gets high enough that it actually\n",
      "2941.18 triggers a positive feedback loop on the pituitary.\n",
      "2944.79 So the pituitary is essentially observing\n",
      "2947.72 the amount of estrogen in the bloodstream produced\n",
      "2949.82 by the ovary, and the amount of estrogen\n",
      "2951.65 towards the end of the second half of the menstrual cycle\n",
      "2954.35 has increased and triggers a positive feedback loop.\n",
      "2958.16 It triggers the pituitary to release more FSH and LH,\n",
      "2962.18 and that helps trigger ovulation, that deployment\n",
      "2966.89 or the release of that one mature proper selected\n",
      "2969.92 egg that's haploid with the 23\n",

      "2973.46 into the Fallopian tube.\n",

      "3053.71 constitutes the first half of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle,\n",
      "3056.902 which we call the follicular phase.\n",
      "3058.36 And it's marked by the presence of FSH and some other things,\n",
      "3061.36 but we can really think about it as marked by FSH\n",
      "3064.3 from the pituitary and by estrogen, or estradiol, made\n",
      "3068.86 within the ovary.\n",
      "3070.28 Then comes the second half of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle,\n",
      "3073.52 which I personally think is one of the coolest mechanisms\n",
      "3076.48 in all of biology,\n",
      "which is that--\n",
      "3079.21 remember the follicle that housed\n",
      "3081.01 that one egg that was the selected\n",
      "3083.23 egg that became the mature egg?\n",
      "3084.88 And that follicle, which no longer contains the egg\n",
      "3087.76 because the egg took off and ovulated,\n",
      "3089.53 is called the corpus luteum.\n",
      "3090.88 And the corpus luteum starts making three hormones, which\n",
      "3094.72 include estradiol, I think called inhibin,\n",
      "3096.628 but the most important hormone,\n",
      "the one that you really\n",
      "3098.92 need to know about,\n",
      "is that it starts\n",
      "3100.6 producing very high levels of progesterone.\n",
      "3104.5 Progesterone levels start to increase\n",
      "3107.89 about the time of ovulation, although just\n",
      "3110.35 prior to ovulation.\n",
      "3111.53 And over the next second half of the ovulatory cycle--\n",
      "3116.24 so about 14 days if it's a 28-day cycle,\n",
      "3117.977 a little bit longer or a little bit shorter,\n",
      "3119.81 depending on the length of cycle.\n",
      "3121.185 Levels of progesterone in the second half\n",
      "3123.04 of the ovulatory cycle are going to increase by 1,400 fold\n",
      "3128.2 compared to what they were in the first half\n",
      "3130.78 of the ovulatory cycle.\n",
      "3132.74 So again, if we were to characterize\n",
      "3134.29 the menstrual/ovulatory cycle in broad strokes, what we would\n",
      "3138.85 say is that FSH and estrogen mark\n",
      "3142.69 the initial part the first half,\n",
      "the so-called follicular phase,\n",
      "3146.71 and that the estrogen and FSH set in motion ovulation,\n",
      "3150.97 and they prime the system for the production\n",
      "3153.7 of a corpus luteum, which produces progesterone.\n",
      "3156.67 And the second half of all of this\n",
      "3158.74 is called the luteal phase.\n",
      "3161.03 The second half of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle\n",
      "3163.21 is the luteal phase because of corpus luteum,\n",
      "3166.6 this otherwise discarded tissue that produces progesterone.\n",
      "3170.56 What does progesterone do?\n",
      "3172.21 Well, progesterone impacts the uterine lining,\n",
      "3176.71 so-called endometrium or the lining,\n",
      "3178.81 the mucous lining of the uterus where that egg that's ovulated\n",
      "3183.22 is potentially going to implant if it's fertilized.\n",
      "3186.7 And so in a kind of perfect way-- or I\n",
      "3189.58 should say, in a seemingly perfect way--\n",
      "3192.4 the egg is off on its way.\n",
      "3193.84 It might get fertilized.\n",
      "3195.98 The remnants of the compartment that let go of that egg\n",
      "3199.76 produce a hormone that then prepares the endometrial lining\n",
      "3203.93 of the uterus for the potential implantation of that egg.\n",
      "3207.32 It's basically making the bed for the fertilized egg\n",
      "3210.17 to potentially embed in,\n",
      "to implant in, and then\n",
      "3213.77 achieve all the nourishment that it needs to grow, eventually,\n",
      "3217.04 into a healthy embryo and child.\n",
      "3219.38 Just an amazing set of biological mechanisms,\n",
      "3222.23 if you ask me, because what you're observing here\n",
      "3225.92 is an incredible economy of function\n",
      "3228.17 whereby the same cellular components that\n",
      "3230.69 are producing the egg,\n",
      "well, some of them\n",
      "3232.48 are being discarded,\n",
      "but they're not being\n",
      "3234.23 discarded without purpose.\n",
      "3236.138 They're being discarded in a way that\n",
      "3237.68 triggers the onset of hormonal expression\n",
      "3241.04 that then prepares the fertilized\n",
      "3242.48 egg to be in an enriched environment in which it\n",
      "3245.15 can thrive.\n",
      "3246.0 Now, I realize that was a lot of detail.\n",
      "3247.67 But we have a couple of key themes.\n",
      "3249.59 We've got the hypothalamus, GnRH.\n",
      "3251.57 We've got the pituitary with LH and FSH,\n",
      "3254.09 and those hormones travel to the ovary.\n",
      "3256.56 The ovary has eggs in a vault, basically immature eggs\n",
      "3260.99 in a vault. Some of those are activated by the presence\n",
      "3264.05 of FSH and LH each month.\n",
      "3266.09 And one of those eggs will be selected and will ovulate.\n",
      "3270.2 The remnants of the follicle and egg\n",
      "3272.06 that are not selected, the chromosomes that you don't need\n",
      "3275.03 disappear in the polar body.\n",
      "3276.83 And the corpus luteum gives rise to progesterone and sets\n",
      "3280.46 in motion the second half of the ovulatory menstrual cycle,\n",
      "3284.07 which is the luteal phase,\n",
      "which is essentially\n",
      "3286.67 the potential for that fertilized egg\n",
      "3288.5 to embed in a nice,\n",
      "nourishing environment.\n",
      "3290.632 And of course, we should all be thinking,\n",
      "3292.34 if the egg is fertilized and then it lays down\n",
      "3294.65 in the nice, comfy uterine lining\n",
      "3296.72 that's been prepared by progesterone\n",
      "3299.12 in the corpus luteum, well,\n",
      "then everything's fine and good.\n",
      "3302.78 But what if fertilization doesn't occur?\n",
      "3304.517 Well, we all know what happens if fertilization doesn't occur.\n",
      "3307.1 If fertilization does not occur for whatever reason,\n",
      "3309.98 that uterine lining is going to shed.\n",
      "3312.752 And that's actually what's referred to as the period.\n",
      "3314.96 It's the actual removal--\n",
      "3317.57 or the departure, rather--\n",
      "3319.22 of the thickened endometrium lining\n",
      "3323.06 of the uterus when fertilization has not occurred.\n",
      "3328.42 And of course, if that happens, we\n",
      "3330.13 need another ovulatory menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3332.44 So how does that happen?\n",
      "3333.44 Well, the hormone inhibin is also made by the corpus luteum\n",
      "3336.94 and doesn't go quite as high as the hormone progesterone.\n",
      "3341.32 But it kind of tracks that increase in progesterone\n",
      "3344.92 that occurs in the second half of the ovulatory cycle.\n",
      "3347.86 But then, if fertilization does not occur,\n",
      "3350.98 inhibin levels start to drop.\n",
      "3353.29 And what I haven't told you is what inhibin does.\n",
      "3355.96 Inhibin, in concert with other hormones like estrogen,\n",
      "3359.71 feed back to the hypothalamus and prevent the further release\n",
      "3363.46 of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.\n",
      "3365.92 If you have an egg that gets fertilized and can implant,\n",
      "3369.82 well, then you don't want more eggs to mature.\n",
      "3373.42 You want to hold on to the ones in the vault.\n",
      "3375.52 You don't want them to mature.\n",
      "3377.56 And hormones like inhibin and, again,\n",
      "3379.768 working with other hormones are going\n",
      "3381.31 to prevent the secretion of things like FSH and LH.\n",
      "3384.58 Now, typically, people are not getting pregnant every month.\n",
      "3387.82 In fact, that's not possible.\n",
      "3389.483 And part of the reason it's not possible\n",
      "3391.15 is that if the fertilized egg implants,\n",
      "3393.11 there are a number of different hormone cascades\n",
      "3395.11 that shut down the production of things like GnRH, FSH, and LH\n",
      "3399.34 in ways that prevent further maturation of follicles\n",
      "3402.73 and a follicular phase.\n",
      "3403.93 But in the instance where fertilization doesn't occur\n",
      "3407.24 and menstruation occurs--\n",
      "3409.15 and I should mention that the duration of menstruation,\n",
      "3412.12 the actual bleeding,\n",
      "typically is anywhere from one\n",
      "3414.5 to five days.\n",
      "3415.84 The, quote, unquote,\n",
      "\"heaviness,\"\n",
      "3417.58 the lightness or heaviness of that bleeding will depend on--\n",
      "3421.27 you guessed it-- the amount of progesterone that is secreted\n",
      "3424.87 from the corpus luteum.\n",
      "3425.98 That's one of the key players there.\n",
      "3428.2 And if menstruation occurs,\n",
      "well, then inhibin levels\n",
      "3434.02 also drop.\n",
      "3434.62 Progesterone levels also drop.\n",
      "3436.15 And when that occurs,\n",
      "there's a positive feedback\n",
      "3440.14 signal up at the level of the pituitary.\n",
      "3443.24 The pituitary literally can register\n",
      "3445.3 how much inhibin and progesterone and estrogen\n",
      "3448.03 is present in the bloodstream.\n",
      "3449.57 And if those levels are sufficiently low, well,\n",
      "3452.8 then GnRH gets secreted again,\n",
      "FSH gets secreted again,\n",
      "3456.85 and LH gets secreted again.\n",
      "3459.08 And the first half the follicular phase\n",
      "3461.26 of the menstrual cycle initiates all over again.\n",
      "3464.48 It's hard to overstate how beautifully orchestrated\n",
      "3466.99 this entire system is--\n",
      "3468.76 The number of feedback loops and feed-forward loops.\n",
      "3471.4 I think if you can just generally understand\n",
      "3473.38 that the first half of the menstrual/ovulatory cycle\n",
      "3476.08 is marked by the maturation of the follicles and FSH\n",
      "3478.96 and that the second half is marked\n",
      "3480.82 by the accumulation of progesterone\n",
      "3483.19 and the thickening of the uterine lining\n",
      "3484.87 should fertilization and implantation occur,\n",
      "3487.69 I think that you will certainly understand\n",
      "3489.82 the female reproductive cycle better than most people\n",
      "3492.46 out there.\n",
      "3493.125 It will also help you understand a number of things\n",
      "3495.25 that are sometimes associated with the female reproductive\n",
      "3497.72 cycle.\n",
      "3498.22 For instance, there are data showing\n",
      "3499.72 that, in many, not all, but in many women, in the four\n",
      "3504.29 to five days prior to ovulation, there is\n",
      "3507.01 a dramatic increase in libido.\n",
      "3508.81 That dramatic increase in libido is\n",
      "3510.67 triggered by a number of things, but some of those things\n",
      "3513.58 include the spike in FSH that occurs,\n",
      "3516.1 the spike in LH that occurs,\n",
      "and some associated increases\n",
      "3520.51 in androgens, things like DHEA and testosterone,\n",
      "3524.03 which, just as in males can be related to libido,\n",
      "3527.74 in females trigger libido.\n",
      "3529.24 You can imagine why this would be an effective mechanism\n",
      "3531.94 to have in place in females if the goal, as it were, certainly\n",
      "3537.07 of the egg, perhaps not of the woman as a whole,\n",
      "3540.8 but if the goal is to fertilize the egg--\n",
      "3544.06 so increases in libido just prior\n",
      "3545.89 to the onset of ovulation.\n",
      "3548.41 There's also been a lot of discussion and interest\n",
      "3551.53 and, frankly, data exploring the malaise\n",
      "3554.92 that it can occur at certain portions\n",
      "3556.66 of the menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3558.82 And there's a lot of misconception about this.\n",
      "3561.13 A lot of people have focused on the malaise that can occur\n",
      "3565.75 around the time of bleeding.\n",
      "3567.73 But there are actually stronger data\n",
      "3570.4 to support the fact that some,\n",
      "again, some, not all women\n",
      "3574.12 experience a kind of malaise sometimes associated\n",
      "3576.67 with anxiety, sometimes not,\n",
      "that's associated with the mid\n",
      "3580.57 to second half of the luteal phase\n",
      "3584.4 of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3587.55 And that, despite what people commonly think,\n",
      "3591.15 is not associated with elevated levels of estrogen.\n",
      "3593.76 It's actually associated with the depletion in estrogen\n",
      "3596.52 levels that can occur during certain portions\n",
      "3599.31 of that second half of the luteal phase\n",
      "3601.89 of the menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3603.37 So again, this is highly variable.\n",
      "3606.81 For some people, they might not experience\n",
      "3608.73 any malaise at any point during their menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3611.49 Other individuals also, for instance,\n",
      "3613.06 might not experience any variation in their libido\n",
      "3615.44 at any point during their menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3617.19 Again, highly variable, and yet there\n",
      "3618.84 are some statistically significant trends\n",
      "3621.06 that have been observed that tracked\n",
      "3622.8 very specific hormonal components\n",
      "3624.42 within the menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3625.74 Again, this will all be very contextual.\n",
      "3628.62 And of course, this can play out in a number of different ways.\n",
      "3631.62 So for instance, some women experience very heightened\n",
      "3633.87 levels of sensitivity to caffeine\n",
      "3635.58 at certain portions of their menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3637.65 Other women experience more cramping than others\n",
      "3640.942 at different portions of their menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3642.9 Tremendous variation from individual to individual.\n",
      "3646.2 One of the--\n",
      "3647.55 I view it as an advantage.\n",
      "3648.78 But one of the things that many females can really do\n",
      "3653.31 and experience because they have cycles that occur every month\n",
      "3656.1 that are fairly dramatic in terms of their levels\n",
      "3658.8 of hormones-- so for instance,\n",
      "a more than 1,000-fold increase\n",
      "3662.76 in progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual\n",
      "3665.1 cycle and, I should also mention,\n",
      "3667.11 a 200-fold increase in estrogen during the period just prior\n",
      "3670.35 to ovulation.\n",
      "3671.16 That's why they always say estrogen primes progesterone.\n",
      "3674.393 That's what you learn in kind of basic endocrinology\n",
      "3676.56 when you're learning the menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3677.86 Estrogen in the first half of the menstrual cycle\n",
      "3679.902 primes progesterone in the second half\n",
      "3681.9 of the ovulatory/menstrual cycle.\n",
      "3684.19 Well, those estrogen increases just prior to ovulation\n",
      "3687.93 are in part responsible for the increases in libido.\n",
      "3692.25 But it's also the presence of increased androgen just prior\n",
      "3695.49 to ovulation.\n",
      "3696.12 So there's a lot of complex interplay.\n",
      "3698.37 I think what we will do is we will reserve\n",
      "3700.5 the discussion about libido, per se,\n",
      "3703.41 and some of the other aspects related\n",
      "3704.97 to sexual differentiation that we\n",
      "3706.14 were talking about earlier for a future episode.\n",
      "3708.14 But hopefully now you have in mind\n",
      "3709.74 what the ovulatory/menstrual cycle is.\n",
      "3711.99 It is a signal from the brain, from the hypothalamus,\n",
      "3715.42 which then triggers a signal from the pituitary,\n",
      "3717.66 an endocrine gland, which then signals the release of hormones\n",
      "3722.04 that travel to the ovary and that control\n",
      "3724.59 two things, maturation of eggs and the identification of one\n",
      "3728.25 egg in particular and then preparation of the milieu,\n",
      "3733.65 the environment in which that fertilized egg could\n",
      "3735.99 potentially land and mature into a healthy embryo and child.\n",
      "3741.13 So if you have that framed up in your mind\n",
      "3743.14 and even if you just extracted maybe 10% to 15%\n",
      "3746.148 of the hormones and different aspects\n",
      "3747.69 that I described up until now,\n",
      "I would consider you far more\n",
      "3752.19 knowledgeable about this entire process than 99% of people\n",
      "3756.0 out there, certainly not the OB/GYNs and urologists,\n",
      "3759.27 but the 99% of individuals out there.\n",
      "3762.49 It also frames up for us the second half\n",
      "3765.57 of this whole story about fertility and fertilization,\n",
      "3767.98 which is the generation of sperm and how the sperm eventually\n",
      "3772.74 arrive at the egg and how certain sperm are selected\n",
      "3776.07 to potentially fertilize that egg,\n",
      "3778.86 whereas others never really stand a chance.\n",
      "3781.15 So next we're going to talk about sperm.\n",
      "3783.062 We're going to talk about what sperm are,\n",
      "3784.77 where they are generated,\n",
      "and how they are generated,\n",
      "3786.978 and how they need to travel both within the male\n",
      "3789.39 and within the female in order to allow fertilization\n",

      "4056.76 That's karyotype with a K.\n",
      "4058.71 Then there's genotype, which are the genes that you have.\n",

      "spelled P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E,\n",
      "4066.84 phenotype.\n",
      "4067.65 And the phenotype is how the genes,\n",

      "4101.17 we are talking about the generation of sperm cells.\n",
      "4104.069 But what we're really talking about is the generation\n",
      "4106.41 of cells whose job is to deliver the genetic material from dad\n",
      "4110.31 to the egg within the female in a way that increases\n",
      "4115.68 the probability that not only will that egg be fertilized\n",

      "4124.89 each set of 23\n",

      "4136.77 and child and eventually adult.\n",
      "That's the job of the sperm.\n",
      "4141.18 So as we talk about spermatogenesis,\n",
      "4143.34 let's just remember that and why they're there\n",
      "4146.067 in the first place.\n",
      "4146.859 Now, a few things about sperm that are interesting,\n",
      "4149.55 besides the fact that they're haploid\n",
      "4151.62 and besides the fact that,\n",
      "as you all know, they swim.\n",
      "4154.213 They have a head and a tail.\n",
      "4155.38 They actually have a head,\n",
      "a mid region, and a tail,\n",
      "4157.547 and that mid region turns out to be very important.\n",
      "4159.729 It's something we'll come back to again and again.\n",
      "4161.812 That mid region is really key for the ability for sperm\n",
      "4164.52 to engage in forward progression to swim forward.\n",
      "4167.7 It involves the activity of mitochondria,\n",
      "4170.17 which are involved in generation of ATP, which\n",
      "4173.58 is involved in all aspects of energy and all cells.\n",
      "4176.34 But let's just remember that the sperm are swimming cells.\n",
      "4180.149 And in order to create a really good swimmer\n",
      "4183.3 or set of swimmers, you need a couple of things.\n",
      "4185.68 First of all, within the testes is where the sperm develop.\n",
      "4189.99 And unlike in females and unlike in the ovary,\n",
      "4193.56 there's no vault of sperm.\n",
      "4195.12 The sperm are continually being generated.\n",
      "4197.64 It takes about 60\n",
      "days for sperm to be\n",
      "4200.22 born from their parent cells--\n",
      "4202.71 because cells actually give rise to other cells,\n",
      "4204.76 that's the it works-- to be born from their parent cells\n",
      "4206.79 and then matured to the point where they\n",
      "4208.457 can be a really good swimmer.\n",
      "4209.67 Now, that doesn't mean that a bunch of sperm\n",
      "4213.6 are made on day one, and then\n",
      "60 days later, all those sperm\n",
      "4217.56 are deployed in the form of ejaculate,\n",
      "4219.39 and then the cycle starts over again.\n",
      "4221.14 So it's a little different than the ovulatory menstrual cycle.\n",
      "4223.74 Rather, at any given point in time-- like right now,\n",
      "4226.53 if you have testes, you have some sperm in your testes that\n",
      "4229.77 are immature and cannot swim,\n",
      "cannot deliver those contents\n",
      "4235.35 to--\n",
      "4235.95 those genetic contents,\n",
      "rather-- to the female egg.\n",
      "4238.77 And you have some sperm that are mature,\n",
      "4240.51 and you very likely have some sperm that are so mature\n",
      "4243.78 that they are dying off or that they're dead.\n",
      "4246.09 Almost certainly, also,\n",
      "regardless of your age,\n",
      "4248.73 you have some sperm that are healthier than others, that are\n",
      "4251.64 better swimmers than others.\n",
      "4253.18 This is just the way the system works.\n",
      "4256.15 Now, the process of spermatogenesis\n",
      "4259.212 involves a couple of things,\n",
      "but a lot of the players\n",
      "4261.42 are the same as the process of developing\n",
      "4263.88 the so-called oocyte,\n",
      "the immature egg.\n",
      "4268.18 We've got GnRH from the hypothalamus.\n",
      "4270.523 That's going to be a player.\n",
      "4271.69 We have FSH,\n",
      "follicle-stimulating hormone,\n",
      "4273.888 although the name's a little bit of a misnomer in the context\n",
      "4276.43 of spermatogenesis, because in the context of spermatogenesis,\n",
      "4279.43 there is no follicle.\n",
      "4280.563 What we're really talking about is\n",
      "4281.98 FSH for stimulating the maturation of the sperm cell,\n",
      "4286.31 so not egg follicle but sperm cell.\n",
      "4288.34 But we still have GnRH,\n",
      "FSH, LH, and rather\n",
      "4292.39 than the ovary being the target of those hormones,\n",
      "4294.76 it's going to be the testes.\n",
      "4296.48 So most everybody should know that the testes and the ovaries\n",
      "4300.4 are the so-called gonads.\n",
      "4302.83 The testes, of course,\n",
      "reside outside of the body.\n",
      "4306.25 There are instances where the testes fail\n",
      "4309.16 to descend during development.\n",
      "4310.66 Certainly, if the testes don't descend\n",
      "4312.57 on time, that's something that doctors need to be made aware\n",
      "4315.07 of, the pediatrician should be made aware of,\n",
      "4316.945 because that can prevent fertility.\n",
      "4320.02 Why would that be?\n",
      "4321.02 Well, it turns out that the testes\n",
      "4323.41 reside outside the body in the scrotum\n",
      "4325.63 because the temperature conditions\n",
      "4328.54 under which spermatogenesis can occur\n",
      "4331.03 and under which healthy sperm can be maintained\n",
      "4334.42 are very restricted and is approximately 2 degrees cooler\n",
      "4340.21 than the rest of the body.\n",
      "4341.99 This is very important.\n",
      "4343.45 I think this is something that used to be discussed a lot more\n",
      "4346.18 but isn't discussed so much these days.\n",
      "4348.88 But keeping the testes cool enough--\n",
      "4351.053 doesn't necessarily mean keeping them cold, although there\n",
      "4353.47 is a place for using cold exposure,\n",
      "4355.3 deliberate cold exposure, to improve\n",
      "4357.7 sperm quality and number and perhaps even\n",
      "4359.89 testosterone levels.\n",
      "4360.98 We'll talk about that a little bit later.\n",
      "4362.688 But keeping the testes about 2 degrees\n",
      "4366.19 cooler than the rest of the body is absolutely key.\n",
      "4369.2 If sperm get too hot, they die.\n",
      "4371.95 And if spermatocytes, the cells that give rise to sperm,\n",
      "4374.59 get too warm, well, then oftentimes the sperm\n",
      "4377.62 that develop are not healthy, not healthy\n",
      "4380.427 in a number of ways.\n",
      "4381.26 Either they can't engage in fast forward progression--\n",
      "4384.37 that is, swimming-- or they will lack the ability\n",
      "4388.45 to deposit their DNA contents within the egg.\n",
      "4391.36 So again, whatever is contained in the ejaculate\n",
      "4394.06 is going to be a mixture of different sperm qualities.\n",
      "4396.31 And sperm of different ages will impact the quality, but also\n",
      "4400.78 the temperature under which those sperm developed is\n",
      "4405.13 going to impact their quality.\n",
      "4406.75 And so we're going to get into tools a little bit\n",
      "4409.27 later, as I mentioned, but just to give you a simple takeaway.\n",
      "4412.42 If you are hoping to conceive in the next 90 days--\n",
      "4416.08 the spermatogenesis cycle take 60 days,\n",
      "4418.24 but then the sperm actually have to migrate from the testicle\n",
      "4421.63 into the so-called epididymis,\n",
      "which is a related structure,\n",
      "4425.17 and then into the vas deferens and then\n",
      "4427.33 into the urethra, where it can be part of the ejaculate.\n",
      "4429.82 In order for sperm to do all that properly,\n",
      "4433.21 undergo that maturation and then exit in ejaculate in a way\n",
      "4436.39 that's healthy or that the sperm is healthy,\n",
      "4439.93 if you plan to conceive children or to try and conceive children\n",
      "4443.74 in the next 90 days, you definitely want to avoid\n",
      "4446.98 exposing your testicles--\n",
      "that is, your scrotum--\n",
      "4450.67 to elevated temperatures.\n",
      "4453.08 So that means definitely avoiding hot tubs,\n",
      "4456.19 definitely avoiding hot baths.\n",
      "4457.69 Now, a brief hot bath or hot tub or hot shower\n",
      "4459.91 isn't going to be a problem, although if you're\n",
      "4462.448 really interested in conceiving,\n",
      "I would avoid hot tubs\n",
      "4464.74 and hot baths as much as possible.\n",
      "4467.47 Hot showers are probably fine.\n",
      "4469.94 But if you're going to go into a sauna, for instance,\n",
      "4472.22 you might want to rethink that decision.\n",
      "4473.887 And if you do decide to, you almost certainly\n",
      "4475.9 would want to bring a cold pack in that you could-- well,\n",
      "4479.17 hopefully put some material between the cold pack\n",
      "4481.27 and the scrotum so you don't get a cold burn.\n",
      "4483.46 But put something there, but keep the scrotal tissue cool.\n",
      "4488.17 Keep it cold to cool because heat exposure can really\n",
      "4492.76 mutate and disrupt the developing sperm,\n",
      "4495.79 and it can kill sperm.\n",
      "4497.18 And so, again, that would be for an entire 90 days\n",
      "4500.92 leading up to your attempts to conceive.\n",
      "4503.137 Again, we'll get into more tools later, but a number of people\n",
      "4505.72 also have probably heard of the boxers versus briefs\n",
      "4509.53 controversy, I guess it is,\n",
      "or whether or not people call\n",
      "4513.94 it going commando with no underwear of any kind-- boxers,\n",
      "4518.32 briefs, briefs, or otherwise rather.\n",
      "4520.79 It turns out that the data on that point to the fact\n",
      "4523.03 that there isn't really a big difference in terms of sperm\n",
      "4525.64 quality if people wear boxers or briefs\n",
      "4528.91 or don't wear anything under their jeans or shorts at all.\n",
      "4533.5 The scrotum has the ability to move the testicles far enough\n",
      "4537.85 away from the body in order to achieve lower\n",
      "4539.743 temperatures if it needs to.\n",
      "4540.91 It achieves that through a muscle\n",
      "4542.285 called the cremaster muscle, which\n",
      "4543.94 is a really interesting muscle, believe it or not.\n",
      "4546.14 I was reading up on the biology of the cremaster\n",
      "4548.14 muscle, something I never thought\n",
      "4549.16 I'd spend too much time on but that I ended up spending far\n",
      "4551.89 too much time reading up about.\n",
      "4553.393 And it's really fascinating.\n",
      "4554.56 What you have is a muscle that is a smooth muscle\n",
      "4557.71 tissue, unlike skeletal muscle,\n",
      "which is striated muscle,\n",
      "4561.46 that is temperature dependent.\n",
      "4563.12 So it has certain nerve endings,\n",
      "and it has certain receptors\n",
      "4566.92 on it that allow it to respond to local temperature\n",
      "4569.41 and then to relax in order to essentially let\n",
      "4573.28 the testicles to descend further from the body or to contract\n",
      "4576.21 and bring the testicles closer to the body\n",
      "4577.96 in order to try and maintain the optimal temperature range.\n",

      "4593.757 but undergarment that allows some movement of the scrotum\n",
      "4597.55 and the testicles should be sufficient to allow\n",
      "4599.62 these temperature variations to occur and keep things in range.\n",
      "4604.0 That said, a little bit later,\n",
      "we'll go into some detail,\n",
      "4607.18 really--\n",
      "4607.69 because it's important-- as to why,\n",
      "4610.09 for instance, if you are somebody who has big thighs,\n",
      "4612.4 believe it or not,\n",
      "that it actually\n",
      "4613.875 can lower sperm count substantially, whether or not\n",
      "4616.0 the big thighs occur because you're very muscular\n",
      "4618.042 or the big thighs occur because you are overweight.\n",
      "4620.83 It can increase the temperature.\n",
      "4622.52 If you're sitting a lot, increases\n",
      "4624.04 scrotal temperature, for sure.\n",
      "4625.655 And there are some other things that can increase scrotal\n",
      "4628.03 temperature, seat heaters in cars, for instance--\n",
      "4631.18 terrible idea, just terrible idea if you're hoping\n",
      "4634.03 to conceive in the near future--\n",
      "4636.71 and again, hot tub,\n",
      "things of that sort.\n",
      "4640.4 So temperature modulation of spermatogenesis and sperm\n",
      "4644.95 quality and function is key.\n",
      "4646.283 That relates a little bit more to tools.\n",
      "4647.95 But what happens?\n",
      "4648.76 How does the actual sperm develop?\n",
      "4651.22 Well, contained within the testicle,\n",
      "4653.47 you have the cells, the so-called spermatogonia,\n",
      "4656.83 which differentiate into so-called spermatocytes.\n",
      "4658.99 You don't have to remember all this.\n",
      "4660.49 And the spermatocytes undergo this process of meiosis.\n",
      "4663.11 Meiosis is a form of cell division, which\n",
      "4665.41 reduces the chromosome number to those 23 individual strands as\n",
      "4669.97 opposed to pairs.\n",
      "4671.08 So it makes them haploid as opposed to diploid.\n",
      "4673.447 Very, very important for reasons that we talked about earlier.\n",
      "4676.03 And the meiosis process in these primordial sperm cells,\n",
      "4680.68 these immature sperm cells, is similar to the meiosis process\n",
      "4684.7 that occurs in eggs when the chromosomes segregate in\n",
      "4687.76 that it involves these spindle-like structures\n",
      "4690.91 within the cell.\n",
      "4691.61 Now, why do I keep bringing up the spindles?\n",
      "4692.98 Well, it turns out that the function\n",
      "4694.24 of the spindle in the egg and the sperm\n",
      "4696.1 is heavily dependent on mitochondrial function.\n",
      "4699.41 And later when we get into tools for improving egg and sperm\n",
      "4702.04 quality, you're going to hear about a lot of tools\n",
      "4704.123 for improving mitochondria.\n",
      "4705.28 And it's not just because the mitochondria\n",
      "4707.08 are involved in energy-demanding aspects of cell biology.\n",
      "4711.19 But it's also because the mitochondria in this context\n",
      "4714.19 are very, very important for the removal of or the separation\n",
      "4719.65 of one set of chromosomes to give you\n",
      "4721.3 these two sets of haploid cells, the egg and the sperm.\n",
      "4724.43 And this is so important because many failures at fertilization,\n",
      "4729.73 many failures at implantation,\n",
      "many, many miscarriages,\n",
      "4733.63 and many birth defects that do survive after birth that\n",
      "4737.05 are very detrimental, such as trisomies and things like that,\n",
      "4741.43 occur because the spindles don't effectively pull apart\n",
      "4745.18 the chromosomes in typically the egg,\n",
      "4748.12 but it can also occur in the sperm.\n",
      "4750.71 So the spindles and the fact that mitochondria\n",
      "4752.95 are rich on the spindle are very important for generating\n",
      "4755.47 these haploid sperm--\n",
      "again, 23 individual strands\n",
      "4757.75 of chromosomes.\n",
      "4759.4 That's occurring inside of the testes.\n",
      "4763.04 So there's not as much long-distance migration\n",
      "4765.88 of the spermatocytes and the sperm cells\n",
      "4769.87 as there is the egg just when you\n",
      "4771.837 think about the overall architecture of the uterus\n",
      "4773.92 and the Fallopian tubes compared to the testicles,\n",
      "4775.54 but there's still a lot of movement.\n",
      "4776.69 So within the testicle, if you were\n",
      "4778.27 to look at the testicle in cross-section--\n",
      "4780.427 and I prefer to call it that rather than cut\n",
      "4782.26 the testicle in half.\n",
      "4783.1 Any time you talk about anatomy, you actually\n",
      "4784.45 talk about slicing things.\n",
      "4785.533 That's what you would do with a cadaver is what I teach\n",
      "4788.53 and we do in my laboratory and, frankly,\n",
      "4792.01 in biological laboratories all over the place.\n",
      "4794.3 But when you talk about it, you talk about if you were to take\n",
      "4796.883 a visual cross-section through the testicle,\n",
      "4798.917 what you would find is that there are a lot of different\n",
      "4801.25 little tubes, a lot of ducts, D-U-C-T-S, ducts.\n",
      "4805.72 Those are pathways.\n",
      "4806.77 And the main ducts that are important for this discussion\n",
      "4810.55 are called the seminiferous tubules.\n",
      "4813.49 So it's a mesh-like or network structure\n",
      "4816.91 of tubes in the testicle.\n",
      "4818.53 And the immature sperm sit on a little compartment\n",
      "4823.18 along the edge of those tubes.\n",
      "4824.81 And as they mature, they move towards the center\n",
      "4827.14 of those tubes.\n",
      "4827.848 And then when they are mature enough,\n",
      "4829.39 those sperm cells actually drop into the hollow of the tube,\n",
      "4833.38 and then can travel through those tubes\n",
      "4835.78 to a structure that's along the side of the testicle called\n",
      "4840.4 the epididymis.\n",
      "4842.2 The epididymis, again,\n",
      "is a series of ducts.\n",
      "4845.02 And then the epididymis converges with something\n",
      "4847.87 called the vas deferens.\n",
      "4849.937 I think in high school,\n",
      "we all remember this\n",
      "4851.77 by thinking about it's the vast difference.\n",
      "4853.6 I don't know who came up with that.\n",
      "4855.37 I think it was a young girl sitting\n",
      "4857.182 to the left of me that was like, oh, it's\n",
      "4858.89 like the vast difference.\n",
      "4859.63 I never forgot that.\n",
      "4860.45 I don't know.\n",
      "4860.59 Maybe it was the topic matter.\n",
      "4861.52 Maybe it was her.\n",
      "4862.03 Maybe it was some combination of the two.\n",
      "4863.738 But in any case, the sperm go from the seminiferous\n",
      "4865.9 tubules to the epididymis and then\n",
      "4869.15 to the vas deferens and then are contained in the ejaculate,\n",
      "4872.72 along with seminal fluid.\n",
      "4874.7 Now, the seminal fluid is the carrier fluid\n",
      "4878.63 for the sperm themselves.\n",
      "4881.427 This is important because it turns out\n",
      "4883.01 that a lot of things that can both negatively or positively\n",
      "4886.16 impact the quality of the sperm relates not just\n",
      "4889.46 to the sperm cells themselves and the temperature\n",
      "4891.89 of the environment that they were matured in,\n",
      "4895.31 but also to the semen quality.\n",
      "4898.37 For instance, if you are a heavy drinker, if you are a smoker,\n",
      "4903.89 or if you are a regular user of cannabis,\n",
      "4907.7 especially if you smoke cannabis or vape cannabis,\n",
      "4911.33 you create a lot of reactive oxygen species\n",
      "4914.66 that disrupt the chemistry of the seminal fluid, which\n",
      "4917.81 disrupts the sperm cells.\n",
      "4919.14 So it's not a direct action always on the sperm cell\n",
      "4921.53 itself, although it can be.\n",
      "4922.77 So for instance, in the form of smoked tobacco or cannabis,\n",
      "4927.418 there are a lot of carcinogens and mutagens\n",
      "4929.21 that actually mutate the DNA,\n",
      "can cause DNA fragmentation,\n",
      "4932.33 and debilitate sperm.\n",
      "4933.53 But there are also a lot of things created by smoking\n",
      "4937.94 in particular, regardless of what's being smoked,\n",
      "4940.91 that can create elevated reactive oxygen species\n",
      "4944.15 and disrupt the seminal fluid that the sperm are contained\n",
      "4948.77 in in the so-called ejaculate, the semen.\n",
      "4951.23 Now, this will also become a relevant conversation later\n",
      "4955.01 when we briefly talk about vasectomies.\n",
      "4957.56 Vasectomies are literally a cutting\n",
      "4961.4 of the vas deferens, which leads to a situation,\n",
      "4965.06 provided the surgery was done correctly,\n",
      "4966.89 where men can still achieve all the other aspects\n",
      "4970.435 of intercourse.\n",
      "4971.06 They can still achieve erection.\n",
      "4973.07 They can still achieve orgasm.\n",
      "4974.93 They can still ejaculate.\n",
      "4977.18 But when they ejaculate, the seminal fluid is released,\n",
      "4980.28 but there are no sperm contained within the seminal fluid.\n",
      "4982.82 And it turns out that vasectomies\n",
      "4984.77 are a very effective form of birth control.\n",
      "4987.41 And they always check to see if zero sperm\n",
      "4989.9 and confirm that zero sperm are being\n",
      "4991.457 released in the ejaculate.\n",
      "4992.54 They are reversible.\n",
      "4993.985 And that is, vasectomies are reversible, but not always.\n",
      "4997.73 There are a subset of cases where it's not reversible,\n",
      "4999.98 in which case if people still want to have children,\n",
      "5002.147 you have to go in and actually surgically extract sperm\n",
      "5005.35 from the testicles.\n",
      "5006.61 But it's a process in which the vas deferens is altered\n",
      "5012.01 or severed in a way that the sperm can't actually\n",
      "5014.29 exit the testicle.\n",
      "5015.96 They can get into the epididymis, usually,\n",
      "5017.71 but not into the vas deferens and so on and so forth.\n",
      "5021.182 So if you've ever wondered what a vasectomy is,\n",
      "5023.14 that's what a vasectomy is.\n",
      "5024.34 And I mentioned vasectomy now because it illustrates\n",
      "5028.833 the difference between the seminal fluid, the semen,\n",
      "5031.0 and the sperm that the semen contain.\n",
      "5034.24 So 60 days to generate the sperm, another two weeks\n",
      "5039.01 or so for the sperm to travel through the various ducts\n",
      "5042.16 to the point where they can be contained in the ejaculate.\n",
      "5045.19 Let's talk about the sperm cells themselves.\n",
      "5047.95 The sperm cells, again,\n",
      "have these 23 pairs\n",
      "5052.18 of single-strand chromosomes.\n",
      "5053.89 They're haploid.\n",
      "5054.92 They have either an X or a Y sex chromosome\n",
      "5056.83 as the 23rd so-called sex chromosome.\n",
      "5059.11 And as we all know,\n",
      "they have a head.\n",
      "5061.0 The head tends to be oval in most cases.\n",
      "5064.19 The head contains very important enzymes and proteins\n",
      "5067.72 that are designed to fuse with the much larger egg\n",
      "5070.99 and to actually take the membrane of the sperm cell\n",
      "5073.57 and combine to actually mesh with the egg cell's membrane\n",
      "5080.58 and then deliver the genetic contents to the egg cell,\n",
      "5084.7 in other words, to fertilize the egg cell.\n",
      "5086.88 Now, just behind the head is a region called the mid region.\n",
      "5090.48 That mid region is a slightly thickened region.\n",
      "5094.29 And here, of course, I'm talking about healthy sperm cell\n",
      "5097.08 morphology.\n",
      "5097.68 Morphology simply means shape.\n",
      "5099.33 A mid region-- that mid region has a bunch\n",
      "5102.45 of things related to cell motility\n",
      "5104.58 and to the forward progression of the cells.\n",
      "5107.56 First of all, it is chock a block full of mitochondria.\n",
      "5110.555 In fact, if you were to look just\n",
      "5111.93 behind the head of the sperm, what you'd see\n",
      "5114.24 is that it is completely surrounded by mitochondria.\n",
      "5118.647 There are mitochondria elsewhere in the cell, but most of them\n",
      "5121.23 are contained in this mid region compartment\n",
      "5123.063 just behind the head of the sperm.\n",
      "5125.97 And that thick region is where the tail movement of the sperm,\n",
      "5130.65 the flagellation back and forth,\n",
      "is actually generated from.\n",
      "5137.85 Much like if you were to hold a rope, like a battle\n",
      "5140.73 rope in the gym, and you were to whip the battle rope,\n",
      "5145.02 the whip at the one end of the rope\n",
      "5147.09 is what allows for the sort of-- let's just call it\n",
      "5152.16 what it is-- the curves in the rope,\n",
      "5153.87 the oscillations, the rising and falling\n",
      "5155.73 of the rope all the way out to the end.\n",
      "5157.77 It is the force of the whip right at that end that with\n",
      "5162.645 the battle rope you're doing with your hand--\n",
      "5164.52 and with the sperm, that is occurring just behind the head\n",
      "5167.46 of the sperm--\n",
      "5168.3 that is actually going to dictate how fast\n",
      "5171.66 and how well that sperm can swim.\n",
      "5174.15 And indeed, the sperm has to swim very far.\n",
      "5176.7 How far?\n",
      "5177.51 Well, on a relative scale--\n",
      "5179.34 and again, these are estimations because they're going to be--\n",
      "5182.82 how should we say?\n",
      "5183.75 There will be differences in the distance\n",
      "5186.9 from the head of the penis and where the ejaculation occurs\n",
      "5193.02 to the cervix, depending on the relative size\n",
      "5195.78 of the vaginal canal and the penis that\n",
      "5198.27 delivers the ejaculate to the vaginal canal.\n",
      "5200.22 But once the sperm arrive at the cervix, which\n",
      "5204.57 is at the back of the vaginal canal\n",
      "5207.42 just at the opening to the uterus,\n",
      "5209.34 once the sperm arrive there, the distance\n",
      "5212.94 from the cervix to the egg, of course,\n",
      "5215.88 will vary depending on where that egg is\n",
      "5218.01 in its ovulatory trajectory, its pathway.\n",
      "5220.92 But it is akin, if you scale for size,\n",
      "5224.43 to the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco,\n",
      "5228.91 which is many, many hundreds of miles.\n",
      "5230.55 So those sperm have to swim very far.\n",
      "5232.71 Now, of course, if the sperm are delivered in the vaginal canal\n",
      "5236.1 somewhat further away, they will have further to go.\n",
      "5239.015 If they're delivered right at the cervical opening,\n",
      "5241.14 they will have less far to go.\n",
      "5242.82 The very effective swimming sperm swim very fast.\n",
      "5247.6 So they are able to accomplish that distance\n",
      "5249.72 in just a few days.\n",
      "5250.92 And this relates to a discussion that we\n",
      "5254.04 will get into in a lot more detail\n",
      "5255.84 later as to how often couples should have intercourse\n",
      "5259.74 if they're trying to conceive.\n",
      "5261.313 Many people might think,\n",
      "well, it's every day.\n",
      "5263.23 However, the more frequent the ejaculation, the lower\n",
      "5266.28 the concentration of sperm in each ejaculate.\n",
      "5269.04 So this is not a discussion about how often\n",
      "5271.11 to have intercourse depending to your preferences,\n",
      "5273.57 for pleasure or bonding or whatever reason.\n",
      "5275.76 This is a discussion about how often to have intercourse\n",
      "5278.61 in order to optimize the probability of fertilization\n",
      "5282.03 of the egg.\n",
      "5282.81 There's some general rules that, of course, come to mind,\n",
      "5285.52 which is ejaculations close to ovulation-- both before,\n",
      "5290.35 during, or sometimes after--\n",
      "5292.83 are obviously advantageous.\n",
      "5295.65 But you will also hear OB/GYNs and urologist\n",
      "5298.62 suggesting intercourse every other day\n",
      "5301.29 leading up to the day of ovulation,\n",
      "5304.02 starting about three to four days out\n",
      "5306.54 from the day of ovulation.\n",
      "5308.34 So we got a little bit sidetracked,\n",
      "5310.17 albeit I think appropriately so,\n",
      "in focusing on fertilization.\n",
      "5314.598 But what we were talking about right up until the point\n",
      "5316.89 of that is the anatomy of the sperm itself,\n",
      "5319.84 which is the head,\n",
      "the mid region that\n",
      "5321.45 contains all those mitochondria, and then the tail.\n",
      "5324.28 Now, what we haven't discussed is the actual generation\n",
      "5327.75 of the sperm.\n",
      "5328.54 So if you're a male or if you're a female,\n",
      "5331.57 I think it's really important to understand\n",
      "5333.57 how spermatogenesis works.\n",
      "5336.81 Spermatogenesis works in much in the same way\n",
      "5340.05 that the generation and maturation of eggs work,\n",
      "5343.578 although, as I mentioned before, it's\n",
      "5345.12 going to occur ongoing throughout the cycle\n",
      "5348.69 of the male's life after puberty.\n",
      "5351.63 We already talked about puberty, and I'll just\n",
      "5354.27 cover this in two or three sentences\n",
      "5356.1 as it relates to males.\n",
      "5357.48 And it's essentially the same thing.\n",
      "5361.35 The hypothalamus, up until the point of puberty,\n",
      "5364.35 is providing suppression of the release\n",
      "5367.62 of gonadotropin-releasing hormone.\n",
      "5369.18 Then some biological clock,\n",
      "which is still not clearly\n",
      "5373.32 understood-- it's probably not leptin coming from body fat.\n",
      "5378.09 Again, unlike in the female,\n",

      "5650.69 involved here and so basic, in fact,\n",
      "5653.67 that if you were to disrupt any one of these chemical players--\n",
      "5656.48 either the luteinizing hormone, the FSH,\n",
      "5659.115 the testosterone from the Leydig cells,\n",
      "5660.74 or androgen-binding protein--\n",
      "5663.05 you would observe pretty marked disruption\n",
      "5667.61 in spermatogenesis or the elimination of sperm entirely.\n",

      "5714.95 the walls of the tubes of the seminiferous tubules,\n",
      "5717.53 can mature into healthy,\n",
      "well-developed sperm,\n",
      "5719.84 and can hop into those ducts, those little tubes,\n",
      "5723.11 and then head off to the epididymis, where they will\n",
      "5725.9 reside-- the epididymis is the tissue nearby the testicles\n",
      "5729.08 or surrounding one portion of the testicle--\n",
      "5731.16 and then eventually fuse with the vas deferens,\n",
      "5733.94 can combine with or be contained with, rather,\n",

      "5760.19 from puberty onward.\n",
      "5761.66 And in doing so, we talked about some of the hormonal elements--\n",

      "the Sertoli cells,\n",
      "5772.32 which are the support cells that allow spermatogenesis to occur.\n",

      "next I'd like to think\n",
      "5780.32 about what's actually contained in the ejaculate in terms\n",
      "5783.02 of numbers of sperm and what's really being selected\n",
      "5786.163 for in terms of the sperm that actually successfully\n",

      "5795.87 And the major themes that we're going to discuss\n",
      "5797.93 are frequency of ejaculation, but really\n",
      "5801.02 that's just kind of a proxy for talking about maximizing\n",
      "5804.59 sperm concentration and quality of sperm arriving at the egg--\n",
      "5808.94 because, remember, ovulation and the menstrual cycle\n",
      "5811.28 are really about creating the opportunity for fertilization.\n",
      "5815.58 And we are also going to talk about how\n",
      "5818.03 the vaginal duct,\n",
      "the vagina, and\n",
      "5821.72 the milieu around the cervix and some other elements\n",

      "5828.41 and support the sperm in their journey to the egg\n",
      "5831.518 and in the likelihood that they will fertilize the egg.\n",
      "5833.81 So really what we need to talk about first is sperm quality.\n",
      "5837.29 And we should also probably talk about ejaculate quality,\n",
      "5840.68 because, as odd as that theme might seem,\n",
      "5844.82 really the ejaculate quality, which\n",
      "5847.998 has a number of different parameters,\n",
      "5849.54 including the number of mature sperm\n",
      "5852.62 that are not so mature that they're swimming slower\n",
      "5854.78 or are dead, but also quality of sperm.\n",
      "5856.56 They have, for instance, one tail.\n",
      "5857.977 It's not entirely uncommon to see sperm\n",
      "5860.3 with two tails because they just didn't form properly\n",
      "5863.06 or sperm that are not moving very much.\n",
      "5865.79 In fact, sperm motility is scored along a scale of 0,\n",
      "5868.99 1, 2, or 3, 3 being the best,\n",
      "fast forward progressing.\n",
      "5872.99 0 is not moving at all.\n",
      "5874.94 1, they're actually called twitchers.\n",
      "5877.382 Twitchers are sperm that sort of just twitch in place\n",
      "5879.59 but don't undergo forward progression.\n",
      "5881.99 2 is somewhere in between\n",
      "1 and 3, not surprisingly.\n",
      "5886.82 Different clinics, different OB/GYNs, different urologists\n",
      "5890.825 will throw out different numbers.\n",
      "5892.2 But in general, it is hoped that more than 50% of the sperm\n",
      "5897.62 should be motile in some way or another, so not scoring a 0,\n",
      "5900.47 but a 1, or 2, or ideally a 3.\n",
      "5903.62 The concentration of sperm--\n",
      "5905.36 of course, if it's higher within the ejaculate, the total number\n",
      "5910.43 of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate, if that's higher,\n",
      "5913.76 then there's a higher probability\n",
      "5915.29 that one of those sperm will fertilize the egg.\n",
      "5918.32 One thing I didn't mention before when\n",
      "5920.0 discussing the production of eggs and ovulation--\n",
      "5922.058 and I probably should have, so I will\n",

      "5937.7 from each ovary, to be deployed during a single ovulation.\n",
      "5940.965 There's a name for that when it occurs and both are fertilized.\n",
      "5943.59 It's called fraternal twins.\n",
      "5946.19 If a single egg--\n",
      "5948.11 that, of course, comes from a single ovary--\n",
      "5950.24 is fertilized and the egg splits--\n",
      "5954.052 and that's something that happens further along\n",
      "5956.01 in the process of fertilization and differentiation\n",
      "5959.28 of the embryo--\n",
      "5960.07 well, then what you get are identical twins.\n",
      "5963.18 There are other instances that are quite uncommon in which\n",
      "5966.457 you can get fraternal twins through other circumstances.\n",
      "5968.79 But in general, that's the way it works.\n",
      "5970.457 But essentially what happens is one egg\n",
      "5972.33 from one ovary-- that's the most common occurrence.\n",
      "5974.7 The sperm, once ejaculated into the vaginal duct,\n",
      "5978.81 are going to pass through the cervix\n",
      "5982.38 and then are going to swim toward the egg.\n",

      "5987.9 along the female reproductive axis.\n",
      "5990.66 Now, this is actually a very important thing\n",

      "6004.34 within the Fallopian tubes.\n",
      "6005.84 So the precise location in which fertilization\n",
      "6008.36 between the sperm and the egg occurs can vary somewhat.\n",
      "6011.27 But ideally, the fertilized egg implants into the endometrium\n",
      "6015.17 or the endometrial lining of the uterus\n",
      "6017.33 and develops there as opposed to within the Fallopian tubes,\n",

      "6022.28 Now, where the sperm and the egg meet exactly\n",
      "6025.94 can vary, as I mentioned before.\n",

      "6030.83 and the more far along the ovulatory trajectory the egg\n",
      "6034.82 are, the higher the probability of a successful fertilization\n",
      "6038.03 because of the proximity to the implantation zone\n",
      "6040.61 of the uterus.\n",
      "6041.46 So basically it's all a probabilities game.\n",
      "6043.82 It's a probabilities game related\n",
      "6045.41 to the number of sperm cells that encounter the egg\n",

      "6181.8 It will vary according to age and a number of other factors\n",
      "6184.74 that we'll talk about a little bit later.\n",
      "6187.23 But in general, if somebody is wishing to conceive,\n",
      "6190.26 then clinicians like to see a ejaculate volume\n",
      "6193.89 of more than 2 milliliters.\n",
      "6196.72 So ejaculate volume can be anywhere\n",
      "6198.87 from 1.5 to 5 milliliters.\n",
      "6202.57 And that will strongly be determined\n",
      "6204.15 by how frequent ejaculation is occurring.\n",
      "6207.16 There's a lot that goes into evaluating the quality\n",
      "6209.43 of ejaculate and sperm.\n",
      "6210.78 But basically these huge variations that are observed\n",
      "6215.36 of anywhere from 15 million sperm per milliliter\n",
      "6218.523 or, in some males who are not producing sperm for whatever\n",
      "6220.94 reason-- we'll talk about those reasons in a little bit--\n",
      "6224.42 as low as 5 million sperm per milliliter,\n",
      "6227.402 all the way up to\n",
      "100 or maybe even\n",
      "6228.86 200 million sperm per milliliter.\n",
      "6231.2 Huge variation-- the cause of which is not always clear\n",
      "6236.06 but is certainly determined in part\n",
      "6238.52 by the frequency of ejaculation.\n",
      "6240.54 So because there are so many variables\n",
      "6243.14 impacting why one male versus another male or even\n",
      "6246.38 the same male across the lifespan\n",
      "6247.79 might have variations in his concentration of sperm\n",
      "6250.73 within the ejaculate, let's talk for a second about frequency\n",
      "6254.87 of ejaculation as it relates to the goal of fertility,\n",
      "6257.325 per se, because that's really what today's episode is all\n",
      "6259.7 about.\n",
      "6260.28 So what I'd like to talk about next\n",
      "6261.8 is how people can increase the probability\n",
      "6264.38 of a successful fertilization, focusing\n",
      "6266.54 both on the components from the male side\n",
      "6269.39 and from the female side.\n",
      "6270.62 And I'm mainly going to couch this discussion in the context\n",
      "6273.47 of the so-called natural method of sexual intercourse\n",
      "6276.8 and ejaculation in vivo, within the female.\n",
      "6281.39 But I will also touch on some parallel themes\n",
      "6283.7 as it relates to in-vitro fertilization\n",
      "6285.68 and intrauterine insemination.\n",
      "6288.17 So the idea here is that we want the maximum number\n",
      "6292.73 of high-quality sperm--\n",
      "that is, rapidly forward,\n",
      "6295.67 motile sperm that are of the correct morphology--\n",
      "6298.35 that is, shape.\n",
      "6299.6 That's going to require a lot of mitochondria\n",
      "6302.27 in the mid region,\n",
      "a well-shaped head--\n",
      "6304.49 so it's going to be an oval-shaped head.\n",
      "6306.17 The tail is going to be a single tail, not multiple tails.\n",
      "6308.84 These aren't going to be the twitcher type of--\n",
      "6311.36 or immotile type of sperm that are either twitching in place\n",
      "6314.6 or aren't moving forward.\n",
      "6315.68 All of those components are going\n",
      "6317.69 to be essential for increasing the probability\n",
      "6320.48 of fertilization.\n",
      "6321.29 But of course, there's the female side of it,\n",
      "6323.165 too, which is that ovulation occurs\n",
      "6325.1 on just one day during the menstrual ovulatory cycle.\n",
      "6328.76 And that egg will be available for fertilization\n",
      "6331.49 for approximately 24 hours.\n",
      "6333.5 Now, keep in mind that the sperm can survive\n",
      "6335.93 within the vaginal duct and within the area\n",
      "6338.81 around the cervix and within the uterus\n",
      "6340.76 and along the female reproductive tract for anywhere\n",
      "6344.06 from three to five or it's even been\n",
      "6346.13 described as up to seven days.\n",
      "6347.85 But generally, it's going to be about three to five days.\n",
      "6350.42 Now, most women can figure out the day of their ovulation\n",
      "6354.2 by counting the total number of days of their typical cycle.\n",
      "6357.2 And this is where it's really useful\n",
      "6358.7 to have a cycle that's of more or less regular duration\n",
      "6362.33 or, rather, of more or less regular length.\n",
      "6365.54 So as we talked about earlier, if somebody's cycle\n",
      "6368.54 is 21 days or 25 days and it's\n",
      "21 or 25 days consistently\n",
      "6372.47 or even 30 days consistently, that's\n",
      "6374.72 going to be a far better scenario to favor fertilization\n",
      "6377.6 than if it's 20 days one month and then 21\n",
      "6380.87 days the next month, but then suddenly 30 days and then\n",
      "6383.87 suddenly 35 days.\n",
      "6385.01 Those varying durations of the ovulatory cycle\n",
      "6388.16 make it very hard,\n",
      "obviously, to time\n",
      "6390.47 and understand when ovulation is going to occur.\n",
      "6392.76 So regular duration ovulatory cycles\n",
      "6396.74 are the ideal circumstance, and they're the ideal circumstance,\n",
      "6399.77 because even though the egg is only\n",
      "6401.24 available for fertilization for a few days,\n",
      "6403.032 those sperm can survive for some period of time, which\n",
      "6406.16 leads to the issue of how often should couples\n",
      "6409.7 be having intercourse.\n",
      "6411.08 And here, I'm referring specifically\n",
      "6413.09 to intercourse with ejaculation.\n",
      "6414.53 How often should couples be having intercourse\n",
      "6416.66 around the time of ovulation if the specific goal is\n",
      "6420.95 successful fertilization of the egg and the creation of a baby?\n",
      "6425.09 This is leaving aside all issues, which, of course, are\n",
      "6428.72 interesting issues, related to how often people are having\n",
      "6431.69 intercourse, whether or not there's ejaculation\n",
      "6433.97 every time they have intercourse or not, for sake of pleasure\n",
      "6436.67 or for sake of pair bonding and pleasure\n",
      "6439.49 or for sake of any number of other potential goals\n",
      "6442.1 of intercourse.\n",
      "6442.91 Here I'm only referring to intercourse\n",
      "6444.92 as it relates to the goal of fertilization of the egg.\n",
      "6449.36 So knowing what we know about spermatogenesis and the fact\n",
      "6455.39 that ejaculate is going to contain a certain concentration\n",
      "6459.05 of sperm but that within that ejaculate some of the sperm\n",
      "6462.83 will be older and less healthy and some will be optimally\n",
      "6466.63 mature and some might even be a little bit\n",
      "6468.38 immature-- although there's a tendency for the immature sperm\n",
      "6470.922 to not have yet exited the seminiferous tubules, gone\n",
      "6475.16 into the epididymis and vas deferens.\n",
      "6476.87 But given that the ejaculate contains\n",
      "6478.58 sperm of varying ages and therefore varying quality\n",
      "6482.27 and given that with each successive ejaculation\n",
      "6485.18 in a short period of time there's\n",
      "6487.46 going to be a decrease in the concentration of sperm\n",
      "6490.43 per milliliter of semen, of ejaculate,\n",
      "6493.94 we can make some good arguments as\n",
      "6496.31 to how often couples should have intercourse\n",
      "6499.28 with ejaculation around the time of ovulation\n",
      "6501.92 if the goal is to fertilize.\n",
      "6503.3 If ovulation occurs on, for instance,\n",
      "6505.07 day 14 of a cycle--\n",
      "and here we're\n",
      "6506.69 using the kind of standard average\n",
      "6508.28 of 28 days of the cycle.\n",
      "6510.0 But for some people with a 30-day cycle,\n",
      "6512.73 it could be day 15, or with a shorter cycle,\n",
      "6516.21 it could be day\n",
      "12, for instance.\n",
      "6517.92 But given a 28-day average cycle,\n",
      "6520.26 let's say ovulation occurs on day 13 or on day 14.\n",
      "6524.28 And typically, it would occur on day 14 of a 28-day cycle.\n",
      "6528.21 Well, then, given how long sperm can survive inside\n",
      "6532.35 of the woman, you might think that the optimal strategy would\n",
      "6535.02 be to have as much intercourse with ejaculation in the three\n",
      "6538.92 or four days leading up to ovulation, hope\n",
      "6541.89 that those sperm have swam as far as they possibly\n",
      "6544.29 can and will encounter the egg just as soon as possible\n",
      "6546.96 after it ovulates.\n",
      "6548.37 It turns out that's not the optimal strategy.\n",
      "6550.32 The optimal strategy is really to maximize the concentration\n",
      "6553.83 of healthy sperm within each ejaculate\n",
      "6556.62 and to really center that around the day of ovulation.\n",
      "6559.98 So what this involves generally and what\n",
      "6562.56 the typical recommendation is is to abstain from intercourse\n",
      "6567.06 with ejaculation about two or three\n",
      "6569.7 days out from ovulation and then, on the day\n",
      "6573.36 prior to ovulation and on the day of ovulation,\n",
      "6577.32 to essentially introduce as much semen\n",
      "6580.95 and ejaculate into the reproductive pathway\n",
      "6583.23 of the female as possible.\n",
      "6585.97 Now, that's the general recommendation\n",
      "6587.73 that the OB/GYNs and the urologists that I spoke to\n",
      "6590.79 gave.\n",
      "6591.63 But you will also hear a different strategy.\n",
      "6594.12 It's only slightly different.\n",
      "6595.44 But the different strategy involves\n",
      "6597.6 trying to maximize the concentration of healthy sperm\n",
      "6600.857 within each ejaculate with the understanding that,\n",
      "6602.94 with each subsequent ejaculation over about a 24-hour period,\n",
      "6606.9 that there's going to be a dramatic reduction\n",
      "6609.25 in the concentration of sperm.\n",
      "6610.5 What that means is that if a couple, for instance,\n",
      "6612.63 were to have intercourse with ejaculation many times\n",
      "6615.75 on the day prior to ovulation, yes,\n",
      "6617.55 that will introduce a lot of sperm\n",
      "6619.83 into the reproductive pathway of the female, but what it means\n",
      "6623.97 is that, on the day of ovulation if they were\n",
      "6625.86 to have intercourse, the number of high quality sperm\n",
      "6629.13 that will be available to the egg will be greatly diminished.\n",
      "6632.73 And if none of the sperm that were introduced\n",
      "6635.28 in the day prior managed to fertilize that egg,\n",
      "6638.4 well, then essentially chances are off\n",
      "6640.74 that there will be fertilization or they're greatly diminished.\n",
      "6643.62 Rather, if they're having intercourse with ejaculation\n",
      "6647.55 once or twice on the day prior to ovulation\n",
      "6650.29 and then a maximal number of times with ejaculation\n",
      "6653.91 on the day of ovulation, that itself\n",
      "6656.31 can maximize the probability of fertilization.\n",
      "6658.72 So which strategy is optimal?\n",
      "6660.09 Should couples have as much intercourse\n",
      "6661.83 with ejaculation on the day prior to ovulation\n",
      "6664.66 and on the day of ovulation?\n",
      "6666.36 Or should they have intercourse on the day prior to ovulation\n",
      "6670.53 but not so frequently that it diminishes the concentration\n",
      "6673.86 of sperm and then allows for intercourse\n",
      "6677.34 with the maximum number of ejaculations\n",
      "6680.01 on the day of ovulation?\n",
      "6681.57 You really hear it both ways.\n",
      "6683.04 And what this really boils down to is,\n",
      "6684.72 frankly, that nobody knows.\n",
      "6686.4 And the reason nobody knows is that there's\n",
      "6688.35 tremendous variation among males in terms\n",
      "6690.18 of the absolute concentration of sperm per milliliter\n",
      "6693.93 of ejaculate and the amount of sperm per milliliter\n",
      "6699.51 of ejaculate within a given time frame.\n",
      "6701.92 But what everyone agrees on is that a period of abstinence\n",
      "6705.84 ranging from 48 to 72 hours prior to an ejaculation\n",
      "6709.86 increases the concentration of high-quality sperm\n",
      "6712.83 within that first ejaculation to occur after the abstinence\n",
      "6716.46 period.\n",
      "6717.91 So again, to reiterate, if one's goal is to fertilize the egg,\n",
      "6720.852 you want to take into consideration\n",
      "6722.31 that most often there is going to be\n",
      "6725.61 a dramatic decline in the concentration of sperm\n",
      "6728.79 per ejaculate any time those ejaculations are occurring\n",
      "6732.162 within a short period of time, say,\n",
      "6733.62 within 12 to 24\n",
      "hours of one another.\n",
      "6736.36 Now, all of this,\n",
      "of course, also\n",
      "6738.39 relates to the female biology and the extent\n",
      "6741.87 to which the woman can precisely identify the day\n",
      "6745.29 and timing of her ovulation.\n",
      "6746.85 Some women feel as if and indeed are very accurate\n",
      "6750.93 at estimating their time of ovulation\n",
      "6753.54 to within a couple of hours or some women even\n",
      "6756.15 report being able to feel their actual ovulation,\n",
      "6759.225 whether or not they are feeling the ovulation\n",
      "6761.1 itself, the deployment of the egg or not, isn't clear.\n",
      "6763.947 I certainly wouldn't know.\n",
      "6765.03 I've never produced eggs,\n",
      "nor have I ovulated,\n",
      "6767.782 and I'm certainly not going to contest the idea\n",
      "6769.74 that women can do that.\n",
      "6772.405 I mean, it makes sense that some people\n",
      "6774.03 have a very keen so-called interoceptive\n",
      "6777.54 awareness, an awareness of the sensory events\n",
      "6779.7 within their body.\n",
      "6781.2 And while, of course,\n",
      "the ovaries are not\n",
      "6783.72 thought of as an organ that we want\n",
      "6785.43 to be able to sense what's going on in there in terms of feel,\n",
      "6788.49 there are sensory endings within the ovary.\n",
      "6790.59 And so the notion that one could literally sense changes\n",
      "6794.497 within their ovary, including the deployment of the egg,\n",
      "6796.83 is not outside the bounds of reason and, in fact,\n",
      "6800.64 could likely be the case.\n",
      "6801.9 Now, that said, there are a number of different ways\n",
      "6805.027 that women will track their ovulation.\n",
      "6806.61 One is the temperature method.\n",
      "6808.15 So they'll actually measure intravaginal temperature.\n",
      "6810.66 They're looking for changes in temperature\n",
      "6812.41 that are consistent around the time of ovulation.\n",
      "6815.11 We're going to have an expert guest on, an OB/GYN, who\n",
      "6818.02 can tell us a lot more about the details and nuances\n",
      "6820.927 of the temperature method.\n",
      "6822.01 You'll see a lot of information about this online,\n",
      "6823.88 but there's a lot of misunderstanding about it,\n",
      "6825.838 as well.\n",
      "6826.57 Other women will use apps that take into account\n",
      "6829.3 either the temperature information\n",
      "6830.89 if they're acquiring temperature information--\n",
      "6833.565 that'll be entered into the app--\n",
      "6834.94 as well as marking the onset of menstruation,\n",
      "6838.9 the onset of bleeding, therefore,\n",
      "6840.37 the start of the ovulatory cycle,\n",
      "6841.87 because, of course, as we mentioned earlier,\n",
      "6843.13 that marks day one of their cycle.\n",
      "6844.9 And then, again and again, you can\n",
      "6846.55 see how regularity of cycle duration\n",
      "6848.95 or relative regularity of cycle duration\n",
      "6851.68 really favors this whole process of being able to predict\n",
      "6854.08 when one ovulates.\n",
      "6856.15 And fortunately, if the goal is fertilization,\n",
      "6860.32 there are some margins for error that are introduced by the fact\n",
      "6864.19 that the sperm can survive within the female reproductive\n",
      "6867.43 tract for some period of days, thereby reducing\n",
      "6871.3 the need for absolute certainty about the time of ovulation\n",
      "6875.17 and so on.\n",
      "6876.05 In fact, it's pretty well known that around the time\n",
      "6878.77 of ovulation a couple of things happen.\n",
      "6880.712 Earlier, we talked about one thing,\n",
      "6882.17 which is there's an increase in libido just prior to ovulation.\n",
      "6884.92 This relates to, in part, an increase\n",
      "6887.83 in some of the androgens,\n",
      "things like DHEA,\n",
      "6891.25 but also testosterone and some related androgens\n",
      "6894.73 that can increase libido both in males and females and changes\n",
      "6900.94 to the reproductive pathway,\n",
      "the female in particular,\n",
      "6904.21 a change in the pH-- that is, the relative acidity\n",
      "6907.48 versus basic nature of the mucosal lining near the cervix\n",
      "6912.25 and also vaginal secretions, such that,\n",
      "6914.74 around the time of ovulation,\n",
      "the entire milieu of the vagina\n",
      "6919.75 and the cervix and the locations in which fertilization can\n",
      "6923.32 occur and certainly in which the sperm are swimming\n",
      "6925.78 towards the opportunity for fertilization\n",
      "6927.79 is shifted to support sperm motility and health.\n",
      "6931.16 In other words, one of the best environments for sperm\n",
      "6933.43 to survive is going to be within the female reproductive pathway\n",
      "6937.51 itself.\n",
      "6938.2 And as long as we're talking about vaginal secretions\n",
      "6940.69 and mucus, it's important to point out\n",
      "6943.09 that a number of commercially available lubricants\n",
      "6945.97 can actually be detrimental for sperm health,\n",
      "6948.56 even if they don't contain spermicide.\n",
      "6950.908 So this is something that you'll want\n",
      "6952.45 to discuss with your OB/GYN or, certainly if you're male,\n",
      "6956.89 you could also discuss this with your urologist\n",
      "6958.96 and your partner's OB/GYN.\n",
      "6961.72 A lot of the commercially available lubricants\n",
      "6964.15 contain chemicals that,\n",

      "7100.17 to achieve successful fertilization and ultimately\n",
      "7103.11 pregnancy.\n",
      "7103.74 And it's very age dependent.\n",
      "7105.33 And in particular, it's dependent on the age\n",
      "7107.55 of the mother, because the age and quality of the egg,\n",
      "7110.49 while it's not the only factor, is certainly\n",
      "7113.99 one of the most determining factors in whether or not\n",
      "7116.45 successful fertilization occurs.\n",
      "7118.28 And as women age, the quality of the eggs\n",
      "7120.8 tends to diminish over time, largely\n",
      "7122.9 due to changes in the mitochondrial function\n",
      "7124.97 and the spindle that pulls the chromosomes apart,\n",
      "7127.52 although there could be other factors involved as well.\n",
      "7130.26 Now, before continuing any further,\n",
      "7131.88 I just want to acknowledge that this whole language around egg\n",
      "7134.69 quality and sperm quality is not the greatest\n",
      "7137.6 language because it's entirely subjective.\n",
      "7140.3 And yet the word \"quality\"\n",
      "in these instances\n",
      "7143.51 is really there to explain a broad variety\n",
      "7146.32 of factors that can,\n",
      "in fact, be measured,\n",
      "7148.07 things like the number of follicles that are deployed\n",
      "7150.65 each month in a woman's ovulation or the number\n",
      "7153.8 of motile sperm or the number of morphologically-- that\n",
      "7157.04 is, correctly shaped sperm in the male and so forth.\n",
      "7159.355 So when we talk about egg quality or sperm quality,\n",
      "7161.48 we're really referring to an amalgam of different features\n",
      "7165.56 related to the different aspects of ovulation\n",
      "7169.01 leading to successful fertilization\n",
      "7170.72 or the different aspects of sperm related to whether or not\n",
      "7174.02 they can arrive and deliver their DNA contents\n",
      "7176.06 and so forth.\n",
      "7176.76 So I will use the words \"egg quality\" and \"sperm quality\"\n",
      "7179.27 just as general themes because that's what\n",
      "7181.04 a lot of the clinicians use.\n",
      "7182.72 But I do understand that it's a little bit of a loaded term\n",
      "7185.18 in both instances, and it doesn't relate to any one\n",
      "7188.09 specific parameter, per se.\n",
      "7190.52 So getting back to this issue of how long couples\n",
      "7192.77 should try according to the age of the female\n",
      "7195.41 and perhaps also the age of the male.\n",
      "7197.36 Well, most of the data that have been collected\n",
      "7199.85 relate to the age of the female, as I mentioned before.\n",
      "7202.44 And what we're about to discuss is,\n",
      "7204.655 within the scientific literature,\n",
      "7206.03 described as what's called fecundability,\n",
      "7208.52 which is the amount of time over which a given couple needs\n",
      "7212.81 to attempt to conceive-- of course,\n",
      "7214.71 by having intercourse with ejaculation--\n",
      "7216.83 around the time of ovulation.\n",
      "7218.78 It assumes that all the other things\n",
      "7220.28 are being done correctly.\n",
      "7222.35 And what we know is that there's a strong age-dependent effect\n",
      "7225.65 that largely rests on the age of the egg-- that is,\n",
      "7228.86 of the female.\n",
      "7229.82 And what we know is that for females 30 years old\n",
      "7234.56 or younger, if they have intercourse with ejaculation\n",
      "7238.565 around the time of ovulation, say, on the day\n",
      "7240.44 before and on the day of ovulation--\n",
      "7243.14 and there could be other intercourse with ejaculation\n",
      "7245.72 around that time as well--\n",
      "7247.73 on average, that will result in a successful fertilization\n",
      "7251.78 in pregnancy about\n",
      "20% of the time\n",
      "7254.84 on the first month of attempting,\n",
      "7256.73 the first ovulation cycle.\n",
      "7258.71 Now, if fertilization and pregnancy occurs, great.\n",
      "7261.788 There'll be at least a nine-month lag\n",
      "7263.33 until they decide whether or not they\n",
      "7264.95 want to try and conceive again.\n",
      "7266.51 However, most couples, even if the woman is 30 years\n",
      "7270.35 old or younger, will not successfully\n",
      "7272.51 conceive on that first attempt.\n",
      "7275.0 And that's because the probability is not 100%.\n",
      "7277.55 It's 20%.\n",
      "7278.42 So 80% of the time,\n",
      "they simply will not\n",
      "7280.82 conceive, which means that they hopefully will try again\n",
      "7284.81 the very next month.\n",
      "7286.02 And if they successfully conceive, great.\n",
      "7288.253 And if they don't,\n",
      "then they ought\n",
      "7289.67 to try again the next month,\n",
      "the next month, and so forth.\n",
      "7292.11 Now, the typical advice that an OB/GYN would give you\n",
      "7295.52 is that, for a woman\n",
      "30 years or younger--\n",
      "7299.12 and leaving aside the age of the father\n",
      "7302.81 but still assuming that egg quality and sperm quality\n",
      "7306.95 are sufficiently high to achieve fertilization--\n",
      "7309.68 that the couple should--\n",
      "7312.485 or if the woman is trying to have kids alone,\n",
      "7314.36 the woman should attempt to conceive over\n",
      "7316.82 the period of six months.\n",
      "7318.59 Why?\n",
      "7319.22 Well, if you think about it, if there's\n",
      "7320.845 a 20% chance in the first month and it's unsuccessful, well,\n",
      "7324.44 then on the second month,\n",
      "there'll also be a 20% chance.\n",
      "7327.08 On the third month,\n",
      "also a 20% chance.\n",
      "7329.0 What I'm describing here is what obviously\n",
      "7332.0 is independent probabilities.\n",
      "7334.43 That is, if you were to flip a coin\n",
      "7336.29 and the probability of getting heads is 50%,\n",
      "7338.46 the probability of getting tails is 50%, of course.\n",
      "7341.48 You don't expect that the previous flip had anything\n",
      "7344.245 to do with the result that you'll\n",
      "7345.62 get on the subsequent flip.\n",
      "7346.67 That's what independent probabilities are.\n",
      "7348.42 However, when it comes to fecundability,\n",
      "7351.86 we're really talking about something\n",
      "7353.36 which is called cumulative pregnancy rate, which\n",
      "7356.12 is not really independent probabilities.\n",
      "7358.25 Now, why would that be?\n",
      "7359.31 Why would it be that if you did not successfully\n",
      "7361.31 conceive in the first month of trying that,\n",
      "7363.8 by simply trying again and again and again, the probability\n",
      "7366.53 of conceiving would increase?\n",
      "7368.13 Well, the reason for that is that this whole business\n",
      "7370.43 of fertilization is not just about what's\n",
      "7372.172 happening with the egg.\n",
      "7373.13 It's also about what's happening with the sperm.\n",
      "7375.2 So there are a number of different events related\n",
      "7377.84 to the biology of the egg and the biology of the sperm, which\n",
      "7380.423 you are now very familiar with from everything\n",
      "7382.34 I've talked about up until now.\n",
      "7383.81 And there a bunch of chance events,\n",
      "7386.248 for instance, that the sperm won't actually\n",
      "7388.04 arrive at the egg in time or that the egg won't arrive\n",
      "7391.012 at the sperm in time,\n",
      "because, of course,\n",
      "7392.72 it's a bidirectional migration of those two cell\n",
      "7394.72 types, or that, for whatever reason,\n",
      "7396.74 fertilization won't occur.\n",
      "7397.935 So what we're really talking about when\n",
      "7399.56 we talk about the cumulative pregnancy rate over time\n",
      "7402.83 is the fact that there are multiple probabilities at work.\n",
      "7405.86 And yes, those are somewhat independent in the sense\n",
      "7408.62 that the biology of the sperm doesn't really strictly\n",
      "7411.08 depend on the biology of the egg,\n",
      "7412.52 at least not until they meet and fertilize.\n",
      "7414.41 But the likelihood of pregnancy depends\n",
      "7418.28 on those independent probabilities,\n",
      "7419.94 which makes this a cumulative pregnancy rate.\n",
      "7422.635 Now, if any of that is confusing, what it basically\n",
      "7424.76 means is that for the egg and the sperm\n",
      "7426.71 to meet and to fertilize, a number of different events\n",
      "7429.14 that carry some intentionality--\n",
      "7432.015 the sperm swims towards the egg and so forth.\n",
      "7433.89 The egg doesn't have a personality in there,\n",
      "7436.82 at least not yet.\n",
      "7437.69 But it, quote, unquote,\n",
      "\"wants\" to be fertilize.\n",
      "7440.27 It is, in principle,\n",
      "receptive to fertilization.\n",
      "7443.42 Well, in order for that to happen,\n",
      "7445.975 there are going to be some events related to chance\n",
      "7448.1 that could limit the ability for that to happen,\n",
      "7450.188 and there'll be other events dictated\n",
      "7451.73 by the biology of those two cell types that\n",
      "7453.59 are driving that event to happen,\n",
      "7455.81 that are biasing the event to, yes, happen.\n",
      "7457.7 And so what we're talking about when\n",
      "7459.2 we talk about cumulative pregnancy rate\n",
      "7461.0 is how much of the biology of the woman\n",
      "7464.18 is skewed towards fertilization to be likely to occur.\n",
      "7468.03 So to make this very simple, all we need to know\n",
      "7470.87 is that for women 30\n",
      "years old or younger,\n",
      "7473.15 because the probability of getting pregnant on any one\n",
      "7477.77 attempt to conceive is 20%, well,\n",
      "7482.21 then if that doesn't occur the first time,\n",
      "7484.55 then she should simply repeat that at least five\n",
      "7486.92 and probably six times before deciding to go to an OB/GYN\n",
      "7490.58 and conclude that there's something going on either\n",
      "7492.86 with the egg or, of course,\n",
      "it could be with the sperm\n",
      "7495.29 because 20 times 5 is 100.\n",
      "7496.873 So we're talking about cumulative percent--\n",
      "7498.665 so 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.\n",
      "7501.47 And the six month there would take you\n",
      "7503.75 to 120%, which is a different thing altogether.\n",
      "7507.63 But in general,\n",
      "that's why OB/GYNs\n",
      "7509.547 will tell their female patients, look,\n",
      "7511.13 if you're setting out to conceive,\n",
      "7512.63 try for about five or six months,\n",
      "7514.56 and if you're not successful,\n",
      "come back and see me.\n",
      "7517.1 Now, for women who are age 31 to 33,\n",
      "7521.33 the probability of conceiving in that first month\n",
      "7523.49 drops to about 18%.\n",
      "7525.27 So women in that age range and their partners\n",
      "7527.51 should certainly try and conceive naturally\n",
      "7529.79 over a period of six or seven months in order\n",
      "7532.49 to get to that 100%\n",
      "cumulative probability.\n",
      "7534.74 And then for women who are age 34 to 37,\n",
      "7537.92 the probability of conceiving in that first month\n",
      "7540.5 of trying and certainly every month thereafter is about 11%.\n",
      "7545.238 So when the age of the woman starts extending out\n",
      "7547.28 to about 34 or 35 years old, then the typical advice\n",
      "7550.76 of the OB/GYN is going to be to attempt to conceive over\n",
      "7554.06 a period of about nine months to a year\n",
      "7556.55 before deciding to take some sort of medical intervention.\n",
      "7560.75 And then, of course, as the age of the woman increases,\n",
      "7563.66 so too does the quality of the eggs go down.\n",
      "7566.51 Now, that's not true for every woman.\n",
      "7568.07 There are many women who, in their late 30s and 40s and even\n",
      "7570.86 early 50s, have successfully conceived healthy children,\n",
      "7574.37 although the probability of that-- the likelihood of it\n",
      "7577.25 drops substantially.\n",
      "7578.73 So for instance, for women who are age 38 to 39,\n",
      "7581.93 the probability of a successful conception\n",
      "7584.42 by natural conception--\n",
      "intercourse with ejaculation--\n",
      "7587.66 is going to be about 5%.\n",
      "7590.06 So it's really dropped to a quarter of what\n",
      "7592.52 it was when that woman was 30.\n",
      "7595.31 Again, these are averages only.\n",
      "7596.99 What does that mean?\n",
      "7597.87 Well, it means that if you are age 38 or older,\n",
      "7601.01 chances are that you should probably go to your OB/GYN\n",
      "7604.67 right at the outset of your desire\n",
      "7606.29 to conceive and ask what you can do to improve egg quality.\n",
      "7609.11 Otherwise, if you were to extend the math out,\n",
      "7611.68 we know that if you're age\n",
      "30 or younger, 20% chance\n",
      "7614.67 in any one given month.\n",
      "7615.91 That means about four to six months of trying.\n",
      "7617.97 Well, you can simply multiply that times four or five\n",
      "7622.02 for someone in their late 30s or early 40s.\n",
      "7624.685 And so what you're really talking about\n",
      "7626.31 is several years of trying.\n",
      "7627.57 And of course, what's happening during those several years?\n",
      "7629.61 The woman is getting older.\n",
      "7630.99 And as a consequence,\n",
      "the quality of the eggs\n",
      "7632.94 is declining even further.\n",
      "7634.9 So if you are 35, 36\n",
      "years old, it might not\n",
      "7639.45 be entirely unreasonable to talk to your OB/GYN right\n",
      "7642.03 at the outset of desiring to conceive,\n",
      "7644.132 but you could also just take the approach\n",
      "7645.84 of trying to conceive naturally for about a year or a year\n",
      "7648.3 and a half before deciding to do that, keeping in mind\n",
      "7651.33 that all the while you can't stop time.\n",
      "7653.31 So biological time and aging is going to occur in the backdrop.\n",
      "7656.79 But hopefully this description of cumulative pregnancy rate\n",
      "7660.45 makes sense.\n",
      "7661.2 Again, the idea is that while it's true\n",
      "7663.87 that every single month there's an independent chance\n",
      "7667.08 of the woman getting pregnant and that chance is dropping\n",
      "7671.37 from abut 20% at age 30 over time to about, really, 1% to 3%\n",
      "7676.08 for women 40 or older, there's also\n",

      "7809.37 Sometimes too many chromosomes move away\n",

      "this word that describes\n",
      "7882.33 the probability of getting pregnant on a given try\n",

      "7915.33 out at the correct times and with viable sperm\n",

      "7920.7 And then, of course, there's the issue of egg quality.\n",
      "7923.1 But in general, most women would like\n",
      "7925.38 to know how fertile they are as a function of their age.\n",
      "7930.09 And I actually think this is one of the most important topics\n",
      "7933.03 in this whole space around fertility\n",
      "7934.8 that isn't often discussed or at least isn't often discussed\n",
      "7937.56 until women are in their late 30s or 40s,\n",
      "7940.74 when oftentimes they will look back\n",
      "7943.012 and wish that either they had frozen their eggs\n",
      "7944.97 or they had frozen fertilized embryos, which is a whole thing\n",
      "7948.6 unto itself.\n",
      "7949.223 And we can talk about that when we\n",
      "7950.64 have an episode on in-vitro fertilization in more depth.\n",
      "7954.0 But there is a fairly straightforward way\n",
      "7957.24 or set of ways that women can determine\n",
      "7959.88 their basic level of fertility.\n",
      "7962.67 Leaving aside a lot of the detailed issues\n",
      "7964.8 about the quality of eggs and so forth, one thing\n",
      "7967.56 that you already learned is that there's this vault,\n",
      "7969.78 there's this reserve that we call the ovarian reserve,\n",
      "7972.42 and that each month a certain number of follicles\n",
      "7975.57 leave that reserve, and there's the opportunity, based\n",
      "7979.8 on the ovulation of a single egg, to fertilize that egg\n",
      "7983.7 and for the woman to get pregnant.\n",
      "7985.29 Now, one thing that we know for sure\n",
      "7986.91 is that the size of the population that's\n",
      "7990.45 released from that vault each month\n",
      "7993.33 has a very strong positive correlation\n",
      "7996.36 with the size of the reserve in the vault itself.\n",
      "7999.85 So the way to think about this, perhaps,\n",
      "8002.48 is that the vault is like a bank account.\n",
      "8004.58 It has a certain amount of money--\n",
      "8006.9 in this case, eggs-- in it.\n",
      "8008.3 And you could imagine, if someone's reasonably logical,\n",
      "8012.05 that if they have more money in their bank account, then\n",
      "8014.42 they're going to withdraw a larger amount\n",
      "8016.718 each month than if they have a small amount each month,\n",
      "8019.01 if the idea is to make that vault, that bank,\n",
      "8022.37 of eggs available to them over the longest period of time.\n",
      "8026.87 And indeed, biology is pretty smart.\n",
      "8028.86 It doesn't deploy or release half the follicles in one month\n",
      "8033.35 and then just slowly trickle out the remainder of follicles.\n",
      "8035.903 No, that's not how it works.\n",
      "8037.07 What you find is that, of course, in younger women--\n",
      "8039.86 so, say, in their late teens, 20s, and 30s--\n",
      "8043.91 the ovarian reserve in the vault is\n",
      "8045.89 going to have more eggs in it, and the number\n",
      "8048.56 of follicles and eggs that leave that vault each month\n",
      "8051.26 is going to be quite high.\n",
      "8052.65 So one way to evaluate how, quote, unquote,\n",
      "8056.21 \"fertile\" you are--\n",
      "8057.71 again, just one way--\n",
      "is to go to your OB/GYN\n",
      "8060.89 and say that you would like to know how many follicles\n",
      "8063.32 you have in a given month.\n",
      "8064.507 And of course, they'll look at them on both sides,\n",
      "8066.59 in both ovaries.\n",
      "8068.03 And for instance, if a woman has just two or three follicles\n",
      "8072.95 that are out each month, well,\n",
      "then the assumption-- again,\n",
      "8076.323 it's just an assumption-- but the assumption that's pretty\n",
      "8078.74 good-- because there is this positive correlation that\n",
      "8081.5 generally occurs--\n",
      "8082.4 is that that ovarian reserve--\n",
      "8084.95 that the number of eggs in the vault\n",
      "8086.81 is fairly low compared to someone\n",
      "8089.09 who, say, has 20 follicles or 30 follicles each month.\n",
      "8093.2 And that's the typical trend.\n",
      "8094.49 Again, these are averages.\n",
      "8095.7 And it's very important to not get attached to any one number\n",
      "8098.33 here.\n",
      "8098.83 Again, these are averages.\n",
      "8100.17 So for instance, there are women who only deploy five follicles\n",
      "8105.23 and eggs each month out of their ovarian vault\n",
      "8107.81 but who find themselves to be very fertile.\n",
      "8109.8 And there could be a number of different factors\n",
      "8111.8 to explain that.\n",
      "8112.49 Other women will have 20 or 30 eggs\n",
      "8115.13 and follicles that leave that vault, the ovarian reserve,\n",
      "8117.71 each month.\n",
      "8118.263 And they will have a harder time getting\n",
      "8119.93 pregnant for any number of different reasons.\n",
      "8121.805 But in general, the more eggs and follicles\n",
      "8123.98 that leave the vault each month, the higher number\n",
      "8127.28 of eggs that are still in reserve, meaning the greater\n",
      "8129.95 amount of time over which a given woman could still\n",
      "8132.65 attempt to have successful fertilizations.\n",
      "8135.9 Now, this small collection of follicles and eggs\n",
      "8139.138 that are released each month actually has a name.\n",
      "8141.18 They're called antral follicles.\n",
      "8142.4 These are small follicles.\n",
      "8143.483 They tend to be about 2\n",
      "to 9 millimeters across.\n",
      "8145.73 The way these are analyzed or measured\n",
      "8147.74 is woman will go into the OB/GYN office, and by ultrasound--\n",
      "8152.03 typically there's some local anesthesia,\n",
      "8153.71 but it's not often a general anesthesia,\n",
      "8155.9 but by local anesthesia or sometimes no anesthesia--\n",
      "8158.99 they will essentially count the number of follicles that\n",
      "8162.11 are present in each side,\n",
      "on ovary on the left\n",
      "8165.05 and the ovary on the right, and give a woman some sense of how\n",
      "8168.77 many follicles she has.\n",
      "8169.94 And typically this is done over a series of months\n",
      "8172.28 to determine how many eggs are leaving the ovarian\n",
      "8175.49 reserve each month and therefore how many eggs\n",
      "8177.89 she is likely to still have in the ovarian reserve.\n",
      "8181.49 now there's a noninvasive way to do this, as well.\n",
      "8184.13 Although, typically, an OB/GYN will do both what I just\n",
      "8187.37 described with ultrasound and measure something called AMH,\n",
      "8190.67 which is anti-MÃƒÂ¼llerian hormone,\n",
      "which is a hormone that is\n",
      "8194.209 released by that antral follicle population,\n",
      "8197.12 the population of follicles and eggs that leave the ovarian\n",
      "8200.48 reserve each month.\n",
      "8201.35 So one is a blood draw measure of a hormone, AMH.\n",
      "8204.5 The other is a structural imaging measure\n",
      "8206.75 of the antral follicles directly.\n",
      "8209.389 again the typical trend is for the number of antral follicles\n",
      "8213.03 to decline over time.\n",
      "8214.6 So one might expect,\n",
      "for instance,\n",
      "8216.48 that a woman in her 20s or\n",
      "30s might have 20, 30, maybe\n",
      "8220.29 even 40 antral follicles that are\n",
      "8222.478 exiting the reserve each month.\n",
      "8223.77 And again, that's the total across both ovaries.\n",
      "8227.1 Again, these are just averages.\n",
      "8228.52 These are going to be distributions.\n",
      "8229.62 There will be people with far fewer.\n",
      "8230.85 There will be people with far more.\n",
      "8232.308 But that over time, regardless of where a woman starts out,\n",
      "8238.139 from one decade to the next half decade and decade\n",
      "8241.24 and so on, that the number of antral follicles will decline\n",
      "8244.469 and the amount of or the levels of AMH will also decline.\n",
      "8248.77 So what does this all mean?\n",
      "8250.629 What this means is that if you are\n",
      "8252.36 a woman who is in her 20s or\n",
      "30s or 40s, whatever your age,\n",
      "8257.73 if you are interested in conceiving in the future,\n",
      "8260.29 it's very likely a good idea to go to your OB/GYN\n",
      "8264.6 and get either your AMH levels measured or your follicle count\n",
      "8268.86 measured and to do that several times in a given period.\n",
      "8272.01 And I don't mean a menstrual period.\n",
      "8273.51 I mean given a period of time across several months\n",
      "8275.78 to determine what is the average number of follicles, what's\n",
      "8278.28 your average AMH level,\n",
      "thereby giving you\n",
      "8282.24 some window into how many eggs you are likely to still\n",
      "8285.99 have in your ovarian reserve.\n",
      "8287.37 I cannot tell you how many women that I've spoken to and how\n",
      "8290.1 many OB/GYNs--\n",
      "8290.7 more importantly,\n",
      "because they speak\n",
      "8292.2 to many more women about this than I ever have or ever will--\n",
      "8296.01 wish that they had done this earlier.\n",
      "8298.75 They think, oh,\n",
      "well, I'm in my 20s,\n",
      "8300.33 so I'm likely to have a ton of follicles,\n",
      "8302.038 or they got pregnant once before,\n",
      "8303.413 and so they're not so concerned about the number of follicles\n",
      "8305.955 or their AMH levels.\n",
      "8307.02 But over and over again, I was told\n",
      "8309.45 in researching for this episode that the earlier\n",
      "8312.27 and more frequent that women do this procedure of measuring\n",
      "8315.51 AMH and measuring their follicle count,\n",
      "8318.45 the higher the probability that they will eventually\n",
      "8320.73 have a successful fertilization and pregnancy\n",
      "8322.83 when they seek to do so.\n",
      "8324.36 Now, the mirror image of all this, of course, is the sperm.\n",
      "8327.78 And there's a kind of common misconception\n",
      "8330.299 out there that, you know,\n",
      "the sperm, you only need one.\n",
      "8333.7 And indeed you only need one.\n",
      "8334.92 But actually, you need many, and it's\n",
      "8337.41 only one that's able to successfully fertilize the egg.\n",
      "8341.25 So this whole concept of you only\n",
      "8342.84 need one is both dismissive of the sperm\n",
      "8345.66 but more importantly dismissive of the biology\n",
      "8347.61 of the sperm and the egg.\n",
      "8349.86 It only takes one successful sperm and one successful egg,\n",
      "8353.653 but that's sort of like telling a woman,\n",
      "8355.32 hey, you only need one egg.\n",
      "8357.299 You need one egg of sufficient quality in the right time\n",
      "8361.26 and place, and you need one sperm\n",
      "8363.69 of sufficient quality in the right time and place\n",
      "8366.24 in order to get successful fertilization and hopefully\n",
      "8368.58 pregnancy.\n",
      "8369.93 But you need a lot of sperm in order\n",
      "8374.219 to get a high probability that that one sperm will\n",
      "8378.209 be able to successfully fertilize the egg.\n",
      "8380.379 So we have this image of sperm as these dumb operators\n",
      "8383.25 that just sort of swim mindlessly towards anything.\n",
      "8386.603 And if they bump into an egg,\n",
      "then they fertilize the egg.\n",
      "8389.02 And that's really not the way it works.\n",

      "8410.04 sperm that they happen to have.\n",

      "8413.49 is relatively inexpensive and also the fact that freezing\n",
      "8417.27 sperm is relatively inexpensive, I\n",
      "8419.6 think it stands to reason that most men should at least get\n",
      "8422.43 some window into the number and quality of their sperm.\n",
      "8425.747 Now, it's a fair assumption to say that if someone\n",
      "8427.83 is in their late teens or early 20s or 30s\n",
      "8431.67 that they probably have high-quality sperm.\n",

      "8456.33 IVF, in-vitro fertilization.\n",

      "8479.52 in a short period of time.\n",
      "8481.09 But after 48 to 72\n",
      "hours, you more or less\n",
      "8484.08 maximize the volume of ejaculate.\n",
      "8486.3 And then, of course, they want to see 50% but typically\n",

      "8496.457 Some males will have anywhere from 10 to 20 million sperm\n",
      "8501.15 per milliliter of ejaculate, and some men\n",
      "8504.48 will have 100 to 200 million.\n",
      "8507.495 But just because they have 100 to 200 million\n",
      "8509.37 doesn't mean that all of those sperm are of high quality\n",

      "8578.88 if somebody-- if the father,\n",
      "that is-- is 40 years or older\n",
      "8581.76 is still quite a bit lower than you would imagine.\n",
      "8584.88 It's not as if the probability suddenly skyrockets.\n",
      "8588.49 So we'll have an episode on autism\n",

      "8596.91 But the point is this.\n",
      "8599.7 I believe and the urologists I spoke\n",
      "8602.04 to who are interested in fertility and male health\n",
      "8604.8 and sexual health suggest that men\n",
      "8606.93 get their sperm analyzed at least once every five\n",
      "8611.01 years and certainly,\n",
      "if they're going\n",
      "8613.35 to want to conceive children in the distant future,\n",
      "8616.05 that they consider freezing their sperm because that, too,\n",
      "8618.69 is fairly nominal cost in order to freeze sperm at a younger\n",
      "8621.85 age.\n",
      "8622.35 And of course, if you can freeze and use sperm\n",
      "8624.54 from the time in which you were younger, why wouldn't you,\n",
      "8627.22 right?\n",
      "8627.72 I mean, you can still opt to go for natural pregnancy\n",
      "8630.36 later if that's what you want to do.\n",
      "8631.89 But having that in reserve is generally a good idea.\n",
      "8635.31 And I discussed some of the parameters that are looked for.\n",
      "8638.01 And perhaps most importantly, there\n",
      "8640.71 is the possibility of an underlying issue whereby,\n",
      "8643.47 for instance, there is very little sperm in an ejaculate.\n",
      "8649.02 As I mentioned earlier, the seminal fluid in the ejaculate\n",
      "8651.78 could have zero sperm in it,\n",
      "but the volume of ejaculate\n",
      "8654.54 could appear completely normal.\n",
      "8656.08 So just because your ejaculate volume is normal to you\n",
      "8659.4 or is in that range of 2 to 5 milliliters,\n",
      "8662.772 well, then that doesn't necessarily\n",
      "8664.23 mean that there are any sperm there\n",
      "8665.688 or that there are very few sperm there and the few sperm that\n",
      "8670.08 are there or the many sperm that there are functionally motile.\n",
      "8673.12 So get this analyzed.\n",
      "8674.25 It's really worth doing.\n",
      "8675.257 And again, it's not something you have to do every year.\n",
      "8677.59 It's something that you want to do probably every five years,\n",
      "8680.37 at least until the point where you've\n",
      "8681.48 conceived as many children as you ever want to conceive.\n",
      "8683.813 So the basic takeaway here is that, if you're a woman,\n",
      "8686.37 to get your egg count--\n",
      "your antral follicle count,\n",
      "8689.94 that is--\n",
      "8690.78 and therefore your reserve of eggs, indirectly measured,\n",
      "8694.95 and of course also get your AMH levels measured,\n",
      "8697.59 and if you're a male to have a sperm analysis\n",
      "8699.72 and to do that relatively early.\n",
      "8701.1 In fact, another incentive for doing\n",
      "8702.6 that early is that you have a comparison\n",
      "8704.267 point so that, for instance,\n",
      "if you are in your early 20s\n",
      "8706.78 and you're not thinking about having kids at all\n",
      "8708.78 or you're thinking that you might someday have kids\n",
      "8710.37 but it's a really someday,\n",
      "someday, far off in the future,\n",
      "8713.28 well, it's wonderful to have a reference point from which\n",
      "8716.28 to compare your biology in your early 20s\n",
      "8719.46 to your biology in your mid or late 30s or 40s when\n",
      "8722.49 you might happen to be interested in conceiving.\n",
      "8725.34 And if that doesn't provide incentive enough,\n",
      "8728.55 I should mention-- and this is important to point out\n",
      "8730.95 and that I think both males and females are not\n",
      "8734.1 aware of-- is that one in five couples that have issues\n",
      "8738.03 with fertility,\n",
      "the issue ends up\n",
      "8741.15 falling on the biology that is the quality of the sperm\n",
      "8744.72 or a lack of number of sperm.\n",
      "8746.83 So I think there's a misconception that when\n",
      "8749.55 fertility is an issue it's always an issue with the eggs\n",
      "8752.74 and this age-dependent decline in the egg quality-- again,\n",
      "8756.507 it's the best language we have available to us at the moment--\n",
      "8759.09 this age-dependent decline in egg quality is often to blame,\n",
      "8762.63 but not always.\n",
      "8763.56 One in five couples that have challenges conceiving it\n",
      "8766.147 turns out that it's going to be an issue with the sperm.\n",
      "8768.48 And of course, there are a number of different sperm\n",
      "8769.92 analyses that, should all the other parameters of sperm\n",
      "8772.86 appear normal,\n",
      "now, for instance,\n",
      "8774.87 you can get a DNA fragmentation analysis.\n",
      "8777.472 You can see whether or not the DNA of the sperm\n",
      "8779.43 are somehow disrupted.\n",
      "8780.99 Urologists these days are excellent at figuring out,\n",
      "8784.53 for instance, if a male has lots and lots of sperm,\n",
      "8787.23 everything looks great, but the shape of the head of the sperm\n",
      "8790.2 isn't quite right-- if it's not oval enough\n",
      "8792.24 and it's too rounded, that could be a genetic defect under which\n",
      "8795.69 conditions there is zero probability of the male ever\n",
      "8801.15 naturally conceiving, regardless of who the female partner is.\n",
      "8804.78 Believe it or not, males can have a ton of sperm,\n",
      "8807.12 but if they carry a certain genetic defect,\n",
      "8809.4 those sperm will be incapable of depositing those 23\n",
      "8812.94 chromosomes into the egg.\n",
      "8815.08 However, there are ways in which that sperm can\n",
      "8818.4 be coaxed or forced to fertilize the egg\n",
      "8821.16 and deposit its genetic contents by in-vitro fertilization\n",
      "8823.71 and then implantation into the female.\n",
      "8825.37 So again, lots of reasons to have a egg\n",
      "8828.54 reserve analysis by ultrasound and AMH\n",
      "8830.85 for females and lots of reasons for males\n",
      "8833.46 to have a sperm analysis.\n",
      "8834.87 And of course, typically with a sperm analysis\n",
      "8837.09 and a ovarian reserve analysis will be a hormone analysis.\n",
      "8842.72 And I'm a very strong believer in people getting an insight--\n",
      "8846.53 that is, a window--\n",
      "8847.4 into their hormonal composition, not just\n",
      "8850.25 when they encounter problems but starting\n",
      "8852.98 at a pretty early age, even if it's only done once every five\n",
      "8855.59 years or so, having a reference point to your 20s\n",
      "8858.77 and to your 30s and mid-30s for when you felt a certain way.\n",
      "8861.65 Maybe, as in the case for many people I know,\n",
      "8864.2 they actually feel better in their 40s\n",
      "8865.88 than they did in their\n",
      "20s because they're\n",
      "8867.17 doing a lot of things to support their health.\n",
      "8868.76 That is possible.\n",
      "8869.76 But in many cases,\n",
      "people start feeling\n",
      "8871.76 not as well or their fertility seems to be dropping off\n",
      "8875.103 or any number of different parameters that we've discussed\n",
      "8877.52 today were related to vitality and longevity seem\n",
      "8880.1 to be dropping off over time, and they\n",
      "8881.96 want to get a insight into what could be the issue.\n",
      "8884.745 And hormones are sometimes, not always,\n",
      "8886.37 but sometimes involved in those underlying issues.\n",
      "8889.2 And there is nothing as valuable as having a reference point\n",
      "8893.21 from a time in which things were going well\n",
      "8895.49 to evaluate the, for instance, levels of hormones,\n",
      "8898.85 not just testosterone but also estrogen and progesterone\n",
      "8901.92 and so forth.\n",
      "8902.85 So you need a comparison point in order\n",
      "8904.55 to determine what really needs to be changed.\n",
      "8906.57 So all of this is a strong push for people to use\n",
      "8910.058 your insurance, if you're able to put it on insurance--\n",
      "8912.35 oftentimes people are--\n",
      "8914.39 and if not, to try and find a reasonable or reasonably priced\n",
      "8918.92 way to do a sperm and egg analysis\n",
      "8922.34 and to ideally do a hormone analysis as well.\n",
      "8925.38 It's really going to set you up for the maximum probability\n",
      "8927.86 of being able to conceive children when you want to\n",
      "8929.985 and also to avoid a bunch of other health-related issues\n",
      "8932.96 that involve hormones and reproductive health\n",
      "8936.35 and, in general, to support your mental health and physical\n",
      "8939.29 health.\n",
      "8939.805 So I've been talking about a bunch of things to do.\n",
      "8941.93 There are a couple of things to be mindful of to actively avoid\n",
      "8945.47 if your goal is to be and remain fertile.\n",
      "8948.41 And that's regardless of whether or not\n",
      "8950.3 you want to conceive children in the future or not.\n",
      "8953.24 Now, in the context of this discussion,\n",
      "8955.04 the same things that we've heard to be\n",
      "8956.75 true for other aspects of our health\n",
      "8958.43 turn out to also be true.\n",
      "8960.06 So let's just start with the basics.\n",
      "8962.66 Everybody should be getting approximately six to eight\n",
      "8966.43 hours of sleep every night.\n",
      "8967.64 That should be quality sleep.\n",
      "8969.11 Optimizing your sleep is fundamental to balancing\n",
      "8971.977 your hormones.\n",
      "8972.56 Now, balancing your hormones is kind\n",
      "8974.06 of a catch phrase for all things related to proper hormone\n",
      "8976.52 regulation.\n",
      "8978.05 Sleep is the fundamental layer of mental health,\n",
      "8980.19 physical health, and performance of all kinds\n",
      "8982.61 and, believe it or not, fertility.\n",
      "8984.68 When people are not sleeping well or enough,\n",
      "8987.35 stress hormones, in particular cortisol,\n",
      "8989.51 shift to peaking later in the day,\n",
      "8991.67 and those elevated cortisol levels later in the day\n",
      "8994.13 cause a bunch of different problems\n",
      "8996.41 in both males and females,\n",
      "many of which impact fertility.\n",
      "8999.11 So controlling cortisol starts with controlling your sleep.\n",
      "9003.08 It also impacts testosterone and estrogen levels.\n",
      "9006.89 So of course, the proper ratios of testosterone and estrogen\n",
      "9009.4 will vary from males to females.\n",
      "9011.3 But in order to get those right or as right\n",
      "9013.48 as they can be without other interventions,\n",
      "9015.473 you want to make sure you're getting enough quality sleep.\n",
      "9017.89 How much sleep?\n",
      "9018.61 Most people need about six to eight hours of sleep per night.\n",
      "9021.58 Waking up once,\n",
      "maybe twice per night\n",
      "9023.277 in the middle of the night and going back to sleep\n",
      "9025.36 is not such a big deal, but six to eight hours of solid sleep\n",
      "9028.15 would be ideal.\n",
      "9028.788 Some people need a little bit less in order\n",
      "9030.58 to function-- five hours.\n",
      "9032.152 Some people need a little bit more.\n",

      "9499.69 Now, another important thing to remember in this context\n",

      "9509.86 the ingestion of that alcohol.\n",
      "9511.75 If you're a male,\n",

      "9546.85 but indeed the entire pool of follicles that\n",
      "9549.34 leaves the ovarian vault in reserve\n",
      "9551.38 and from which the one egg will be selected.\n",
      "9553.85 In other words, you are reducing the quality of all of the eggs\n",
      "9558.55 that you happen to deploy that month.\n",
      "9560.26 Now, some of you who were really following the biology earlier\n",
      "9562.928 might say, well, what if I have those five or six\n",
      "9564.97 drinks during the time in which I'm menstruating, just in which\n",
      "9568.15 there's bleeding present?\n",
      "9569.77 And therefore, I haven't yet ovulated.\n",
      "9572.51 Ah!\n",

      "9584.65 is selected for and ovulates.\n",
      "9586.2 And of course, there are all the different hormonal cascades\n",
      "9588.7 and the general milieu of the ovary which\n",
      "9590.86 are important and are being regulated\n",
      "9592.493 by different hormones.\n",
      "9593.41 And yes, indeed, the regulation of those hormones\n",
      "9595.96 is strongly impacted by alcohol through a number\n",

      "9617.14 Again and again,\n",
      "what we're seeing\n",

      "9625.96 of fertility and the entire process of healthy pregnancy.\n",

      "9640.96 the best thing to do would be avoid alcohol altogether\n",

      "9783.26 to a child that has something like a herpes infection or HIV?\n",
      "9788.383 Well, certainly that's one reason,\n",
      "9789.8 but that's a down-the-line reason, because\n",
      "9791.45 at the time when someone goes into the clinic for one\n",
      "9793.658 of these sperm or egg analyses,\n",
      "that's well in advance\n",
      "9796.91 of any pregnancy, right?\n",
      "9798.17 The reason is there are a number of STIs--\n",
      "9800.9 in particular chlamydia-- for which it greatly increases\n",
      "9804.35 the probability of miscarriage.\n",
      "9805.79 So chlamydia is one of those very insidious and cryptic STIs\n",

      "11001.38 for reasons I talked about a few minutes ago, and for women\n",
      "11005.7 that deliberate, cold exposure can be beneficial\n",

      "11020.07 Well, it turns out, when you get into the cold,\n",
      "11022.028 you get a big surge in adrenaline\n",
      "11023.46 and then dopamine, which is very long lasting,\n",
      "11025.44 provided that's done in the early part of the day.\n",
      "11027.7 So I would say, not too close to sleep.\n",
      "11030.09 Then what you do is you restrict your maximum cortisol release\n",
      "11033.3 to a period earlier in the day that buffers--\n",
      "11037.32 reduces, that is--\n",
      "the likelihood\n",
      "11039.15 that you would have excessive amounts of cortisol later\n",

      "11068.262 impacting those things.\n",
      "11069.22 Does that make sense?\n",
      "11069.69 Heat is bad.\n",

      "11072.33 Likewise, with females,\n",
      "deliberate cold exposure\n",

      "11091.02 as a way to restrict stress in a deliberate\n",
      "11093.36 way to a particular time of day increases\n",
      "11096.33 the release of cortisol,\n",

      "11179.25 But we can use a general rule of thumb here, which\n",
      "11182.28 is that, for most people,\n",
      "getting anywhere from 30\n",
      "11185.22 and ideally 45 to 60\n",
      "minutes of exercise per day\n",
      "11189.24 for six days per week,\n",
      "maybe even seven--\n",
      "11191.49 but most people like to take a day off or need\n",
      "11193.56 to take a complete day off each week--\n",

      "they might have to, of course,\n",

      "11215.148 that they're doing.\n",
      "11215.94 There are varying opinions on that,\n",
      "11217.398 but certainly the type of exercise and the amount\n",
      "11220.35 can vary when people are pregnant.\n",
      "11221.86 But if you're seeking to conceive,\n",
      "11223.497 getting enough exercise is good because it's\n",

      "11246.3 I mean, let's be fair, everybody is restricting their feeding\n",

      "11250.71 at some point in the 24-hour cycle,\n",
      "11252.51 and nobody is eating while they are sleeping.\n",

      "11277.74 is going to be the most important variable.\n",

      "11481.71 going to be a caloric deficit brought on\n",
      "11484.32 by excess physical activity.\n",

      "11513.66 there's essentially no data we can look to.\n",

      "11523.53 And this was something that was covered\n",

      "11536.03 if you want to learn all about hormone optimization in males.\n",
      "11539.0 And essentially, the story is as follows.\n",
      "11541.62 If a male is excessively overweight,\n",
      "11544.77 he's carrying too much body fat in particular, not too\n",
      "11547.37 much muscle--\n",
      "11547.912 although that can be an issue too,\n",
      "11549.328 but too much body fat is typically the issue--\n",
      "11551.45 so more than, say,\n",
      "20% body fat--\n",
      "11555.53 well, then losing body fat is going\n",
      "11558.02 to be the primary goal for maximizing testosterone, sperm\n",

      "11563.69 If, however, a male is already lean, well, then actually\n",
      "11567.92 increasing calories will increase testosterone.\n",
      "11571.19 So it's a bit of a complicated story,\n",
      "11573.587 although not so complicated that none of us can understand it.\n",
      "11576.17 Basically, if you're overweight, you\n",
      "11578.03 should focus on losing weight in order to maximize sperm quality\n",
      "11580.94 and health.\n",
      "11581.51 If you are very lean, well,\n",
      "then restricting your calories\n",
      "11585.08 to the point where you are starting to lose weight\n",
      "11587.96 or you're dropping even more body fat\n",
      "11590.66 is unlikely to increase your testosterone further.\n",
      "11593.75 It doesn't necessarily mean it's bad\n",
      "11595.37 or that you shouldn't try and go, for instance,\n",
      "11597.59 from 15% to 10% body fat.\n",
      "11599.025 I'm not saying that that's bad and that\n",
      "11600.65 will reduce your testosterone.\n",

      "body fat, 5% body\n",
      "11606.408 fat-- and you start restricting calories further,\n",
      "11608.45 your testosterone levels will drop.\n",
      "11610.71 So in the context of intermittent fasting,\n",
      "11612.76 it's really not an issue of whether or not\n",
      "11614.51 your feeding window is\n",
      "8 hours or 12 hours.\n",
      "11616.64 It's really an issue of whether or not\n",
      "11618.223 you're getting enough calories to offset the physical demands\n",
      "11620.9 and activities of your life, whether or not\n",
      "11623.03 you're on a maintenance diet to maintain your weight.\n",
      "11625.28 And of course, you have to put all that in the context of\n",
      "11627.23 whether or not you're overweight or lean to begin with.\n",
      "11629.54 The simple thing to take away from this\n",
      "11631.25 is, if you're a male who's using--\n",
      "11633.14 because you like it--\n",
      "intermittent fasting,\n",
      "11635.12 so-called time-restricted feeding,\n",

      "11644.61 If you're eating over the course of 8 or 10 or 12 hours per day\n",
      "11647.96 because that's what works for you and you are ingesting\n",

      "11664.295 you're probably optimizing for all the things\n",
      "11666.17 that you need to do in order to improve sperm quality\n",

      "11672.02 with Dr. Kyle Gillette on optimizing hormones for males,\n",
      "11675.08 we talked about testosterone replacement therapy.\n",
      "11677.42 It's not a topic I want to get into in any detail right now.\n",
      "11680.19 But I will say this.\n",
      "11681.74 Remember earlier when we were talking about spermatogenesis\n",
      "11684.38 and the fact that in order for sperm to be generated\n",
      "11686.87 consistently every month ongoing from the time of puberty\n",
      "11690.83 until essentially the time that a man dies,\n",
      "11694.04 you need two things.\n",
      "11695.25 You need testosterone production from the Leydig cells\n",
      "11697.64 of the testes, and you need spermatogenesis\n",
      "11701.42 to be supported by that androgen-binding protein\n",
      "11704.54 coming from the support cells, from the Sertoli cells.\n",
      "11707.42 So you need testosterone, and you\n",
      "11708.8 need androgen-binding protein,\n",
      "and you need the Leydig cells\n",
      "11711.38 and the Sertoli cells active.\n",
      "11713.27 When men take exogenous,\n",
      "meaning from outside the body,\n",

      "11719.51 typically by injection--\n",
      "the most typical TRT\n",

      "11724.19 is biologically identical to the kind of testosterone\n",
      "11728.0 you would make.\n",
      "11728.69 Well, because of negative feedback loops, which you also\n",
      "11731.12 learned about earlier, the testicles\n",
      "11733.82 themselves shut down their own testosterone production.\n",
      "11737.69 Why would that be?\n",
      "11738.44 OK, so you're taking testosterone in by syringe\n",
      "11741.14 or by patch or any other method.\n",
      "11743.88 So the circulating testosterone and the amount that\n",
      "11746.18 arrives at the testicle is going to be hopefully\n",
      "11749.69 clinically appropriate,\n",
      "not super physiological,\n",
      "11751.76 but it'll be somewhere in the healthy reference range,\n",

      "11768.65 We're talking about within physiological\n",
      "11770.75 or near physiological ranges.\n",

      "11778.13 the levels of circulating testosterone\n",

      "11812.18 to stimulate the testes to continue to make testosterone.\n",
      "11816.23 And some men will also--\n",
      "11818.45 or instead-- take FSH to stimulate the Sertoli cells\n",
      "11822.8 to support spermatogenesis--\n",
      "excuse me--\n",

      "12021.37 Any time there's a discussion about fertility and pregnancy,\n",
      "12025.54 there seems to also be a parallel discussion\n",
      "12027.7 about sex determination.\n",
      "12029.47 That is, what factors can influence whether or not\n",
      "12032.83 the child that's born is male or female.\n",
      "12035.41 That is, whether or not it has double X chromosomes-- so one X\n",
      "12038.53 chromosome from mom, one X chromosome from dad\n",
      "12040.72 because the egg was fertilized by a sperm that\n",
      "12042.91 had an X sex chromosome,\n",
      "that 23rd chromosome--\n",
      "12046.15 or whether or not the offspring is male, whether or not\n",
      "12048.91 it has the X chromosome from mom, because it's always going\n",
      "12051.368 to be the X chromosome in that egg,\n",
      "12053.83 and a Y chromosome from the sperm that\n",
      "12056.14 fertilized that particular egg.\n",
      "12057.815 Now, of course, there are instances out\n",
      "12059.44 there of people that have XXY chromosomes or XYY chromosomes.\n",
      "12064.87 But the vast majority of people out there\n",
      "12067.9 are going to have either an XX chromosome-- so we\n",
      "12072.04 call that a female karyotype.\n",
      "12074.74 This is different than genotype and phenotype,\n",
      "12076.99 but a female karyotype would be XX--\n",
      "12080.23 or a male karyotype,\n",
      "which would be XY.\n",
      "12084.76 Now, despite the fact that it is the egg and the sperm\n",
      "12087.31 and the chromosomes that they carry\n",
      "12088.768 that are going to determine the chromosomes,\n",
      "12091.01 there's a lot of lore and discussion about the factors\n",
      "12094.27 that can bias which sperm will fertilize the egg\n",
      "12098.14 and thereby whether or not you're\n",
      "12099.67 going to get an XX, female,\n",
      "or an XY, male, chromosome\n",
      "12103.27 and therefore offspring.\n",
      "12104.63 Now, not only is the lore around this whole issue of sex\n",
      "12107.68 determination rather prominent,\n",
      "but it is also somewhat unusual\n",
      "12112.33 and perhaps even interesting.\n",
      "12113.86 So for instance,\n",
      "Aristotle himself proposed\n",
      "12117.58 that if a man is thinking about himself and his own pleasure\n",
      "12122.44 more than his partner and her pleasure\n",
      "12126.25 at the point of ejaculation, then\n",
      "12129.46 the offspring will be male.\n",
      "12131.11 Aristotle also asserted that if a man is thinking\n",
      "12133.51 more about his partner and her pleasure\n",
      "12135.76 at the point in which he ejaculates, well, then\n",
      "12138.85 the offspring would be female.\n",
      "12140.83 And of course, we have zero reason\n",
      "12143.17 to believe that there's any truth to Aristotle's theory.\n",
      "12146.11 There are no data to support that.\n",
      "12147.693 In fact, I'm not even sure how you\n",
      "12149.11 would run that experiment because you can't really\n",
      "12151.81 look at people's thoughts.\n",
      "12153.31 You'd have to rely on honest self-report.\n",
      "12156.31 And even if people were to faithfully report\n",
      "12159.43 what they were thinking about at the moment of ejaculation,\n",
      "12162.35 this would involve, of course, bringing people\n",
      "12164.267 into the laboratory and somehow measuring or analyzing\n",
      "12167.22 their thoughts or gathering their thoughts\n",
      "12168.97 during the sexual intercourse at the point of ejaculation,\n",
      "12172.15 then figuring out which biological sex was\n",
      "12175.0 the offspring, et cetera.\n",
      "12176.59 Just near impossible and probably not the most important\n",
      "12179.71 experiment to invest our time doing.\n",
      "12181.9 Nonetheless, there continues to be\n",
      "12185.26 a lot of lore about what determines\n",
      "12187.668 the sex of the offspring.\n",
      "12188.71 Most notably, there's a lot of lore and discussion\n",
      "12191.17 and rumor about the idea that particular sexual positions\n",
      "12195.31 at the point of ejaculation during intercourse\n",
      "12198.04 can somehow bias the likelihood that a pregnancy will\n",
      "12202.03 be either resulting in male or female offspring.\n",
      "12206.43 Now, again, there are zero data to support this,\n",
      "12208.79 and yet this whole notion of sex determination\n",
      "12211.88 is a really interesting one that people\n",
      "12213.56 seem to be somewhat obsessed by, so much so that, again,\n",
      "12217.31 if you go online or if you were to talk\n",
      "12219.08 to people in the sort of let's call it holistic\n",
      "12222.17 or peripheral health spaces related to fertility,\n",
      "12226.26 there is discussion about, OK, well,\n",
      "12227.96 you take this sexual position at the point of ejaculation\n",
      "12230.42 to get a boy and you take that sexual position\n",
      "12232.337 at the point of ejaculation to get a girl\n",
      "12234.05 or you do this in the early part of the day\n",
      "12236.75 or the later part of the day.\n",
      "12238.38 Again, all for which there is zero\n",
      "12240.71 data to support any kind of systematic relationship\n",
      "12244.34 between what I just discussed and the biological sex\n",
      "12246.53 of the offspring.\n",
      "12247.37 That said, there are now emerging methods\n",
      "12251.21 that people are using in order to separate out the sperm that\n",
      "12257.0 will indeed give rise to a male offspring\n",
      "12260.36 versus a female offspring.\n",
      "12261.87 Now, this, of course,\n",
      "is done in the context\n",
      "12263.72 of in-vitro fertilization.\n",
      "12265.437 We haven't talked too much about in-vitro fertilization.\n",
      "12267.77 But in-vitro fertilization involves,\n",
      "12269.84 as the name suggests, taking an egg and taking a sperm,\n",
      "12273.8 pairing them in a dish.\n",
      "12275.18 This can be done a number of different ways.\n",
      "12277.88 But just to briefly describe the IVF procedure,\n",
      "12280.91 IVF involves administering supra--\n",
      "12284.62 meaning greater than normal--\n",
      "supraphysiological levels\n",
      "12288.32 of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone\n",
      "12291.89 during the follicular phase of a woman's cycle.\n",
      "12294.44 What that causes is the maturation of not just one\n",
      "12298.31 egg that would be ovulated but multiple follicles and eggs.\n",
      "12303.63 And then ovulation itself is suppressed also\n",
      "12307.25 through the administration of exogenous hormones.\n",
      "12310.04 And then, under ultrasound guidance,\n",
      "12312.59 an OB/GYN goes in and collects the mature eggs and follicles,\n",
      "12316.43 puts them in a dish, and then sperm\n",
      "12318.337 are delivered to that dish,\n",
      "and those could either\n",
      "12320.42 be sperm that were frozen previously,\n",
      "12322.7 or more typically or ideally,\n",
      "it would be live sperm collected\n",
      "12326.21 that day that are washed through a very\n",
      "12329.27 straightforward procedure.\n",
      "12331.04 And then those sperm either are allowed\n",
      "12333.23 to compete for those eggs and fertilize those eggs\n",
      "12335.87 and allow them to advance to very early embryo stage\n",
      "12339.71 before those embryos are frozen and eventually implanted\n",
      "12342.2 into a woman in order to have them be carried to full term,\n",
      "12346.5 ideally.\n",
      "12347.18 Or there's a procedure in which specific sperm are selected\n",
      "12351.26 because they have the best morphology, motility,\n",
      "12353.45 and so forth.\n",
      "12354.26 And in a process called ICSI, I-C-S-I,\n",
      "12357.68 in which the sperm themselves are literally forced\n",
      "12361.79 to fertilize that particular egg.\n",
      "12364.02 Now, under those conditions,\n",
      "typically a couple or a woman,\n",
      "12370.957 if she's doing this on her own with a sperm donor,\n",
      "12373.04 will get multiple fertilized embryos\n",
      "12376.61 that are carried to a multicellular stage\n",
      "12380.18 so that it's clear that they could grow into a child\n",
      "12383.45 if they were implanted into a viable host--\n",
      "12386.507 sometimes the surrogate,\n",
      "sometimes the woman\n",
      "12388.34 who wants the child herself.\n",
      "12390.17 And under those conditions, it is\n",
      "12391.88 possible to look at the genetic makeup,\n",
      "12393.77 including the karyotype,\n",
      "of those early nascent\n",
      "12397.04 embryos, in which case people really can select\n",
      "12400.31 the sex of their offspring.\n",
      "12401.48 That is, they will have some embryos that are\n",
      "12405.26 XX, some embryos that are XY.\n",
      "12407.51 It's very likely,\n",
      "also, that they\n",
      "12409.01 will have some embryos that have karyotypes or genotypes which\n",
      "12413.24 are not ideal in that they would potentially\n",
      "12416.33 lead to a miscarriage or some other genetic defect.\n",
      "12418.58 And so, typically,\n",
      "people do not select\n",
      "12421.4 to implant those embryos if they have the option\n",
      "12425.12 to implant embryos that are of either XX or XY karyotype\n",
      "12430.49 and the normal chromosomal arrangements\n",
      "12433.67 for obvious reasons.\n",
      "12436.07 So the whole point here is that sex selection is possible,\n",
      "12440.03 but only using in-vitro fertilization.\n",
      "12443.18 The other thing that is becoming clear to us\n",
      "12445.7 in more recent years is that sex selection is actually\n",
      "12449.3 possible at the level of the sperm even prior\n",
      "12451.97 to fertilization.\n",
      "12453.21 This is an emerging data set, and this is largely\n",
      "12456.47 happening in clinics outside of the United States.\n",
      "12458.69 But there are some clinics that have figured out methods\n",
      "12461.12 in which they can take a sperm sample\n",
      "12463.19 and they can spin that sperm sample in a centrifuge\n",
      "12466.7 at a rate that separates out the sperm into what\n",
      "12469.4 are called different fractions.\n",
      "12470.85 So for those of you who've done a little bit of biology\n",
      "12472.4 with centrifuge, it's when you spin any kind of substance\n",
      "12475.31 that includes multiple things in it of different weights.\n",
      "12478.165 When you spin them, the things of different weights\n",
      "12480.29 segregate out into different fractions\n",
      "12482.423 along the depth of the tube.\n",
      "12483.59 And then you can take out one fraction or the next\n",
      "12485.81 simply with a little pipette.\n",
      "12486.86 You take out the top fraction, the middle fraction,\n",
      "12488.985 and so forth.\n",
      "12489.6 And what these clinics have figured out\n",
      "12491.24 is that if they spin the sperm sample at the correct spin rate\n",
      "12496.07 that the sperm that will give rise\n",
      "12499.1 to male offspring and the sperm that will give rise\n",
      "12502.67 to female offspring segregate out into different fractions,\n",
      "12505.73 allowing them to take each of those fractions separately\n",
      "12509.69 and to apply them to eggs, if it's in-vitro fertilization,\n",
      "12513.71 and give rise very reliably,\n",
      "certainly much more\n",
      "12517.13 than chance, to either male or female embryos.\n",
      "12521.39 They also, of course,\n",
      "can choose to do\n",
      "12523.76 this outside the context of in-vitro fertilization.\n",
      "12526.2 So some people are now opting to have their sperm samples spun\n",
      "12529.67 out in this way, separate out the sperm that give rise\n",
      "12532.85 to male or female offspring, and then\n",
      "12534.59 to only use the fraction that they are interested in--\n",
      "12538.59 so if they want a boy,\n",
      "they'll use one fraction.\n",
      "12540.59 If they want a girl, they'll use different fraction--\n",
      "12543.02 and then to use those fractions in the context of what's\n",
      "12546.65 called IUI, or intrauterine insemination, which\n",
      "12549.98 is, as the name suggests, rather than having the man deliver\n",
      "12554.0 the ejaculate with his penis and the sperm with his penis,\n",
      "12556.46 they have a device.\n",
      "12557.99 The devices are now commercially sold.\n",
      "12559.89 Believe it or not, they're sold over-the-counter\n",
      "12561.89 and on the internet, so people will even do this at home.\n",
      "12564.21 And so what they're doing is they'll take the sperm,\n",
      "12566.377 and they'll do IUI in order to bias the probability\n",
      "12571.1 that they're going to get a male or a female offspring.\n",
      "12573.62 Again, this is something that's now emerging.\n",
      "12576.32 It's not commonplace.\n",
      "12577.91 Most of the time, people simply roll the dice, as it were,\n",
      "12582.26 by having either intercourse and just hoping for or not\n",

      "12839.625 And yet I do find it interesting that there's\n",
      "12842.09 this split in the opinion about this.\n",
      "12845.04 One group, the group that said,\n",
      "no, pelvic position doesn't\n",

      "12851.62 it's not going to influence the rates of fertilization,\n",
      "12854.46 argued that the sperm swim very quickly\n",
      "12857.595 and that if they are released near the cervix\n",
      "12859.47 they're going to swim very quickly toward the egg\n",
      "12862.08 in order to fertilize it regardless of pelvic position.\n",
      "12865.86 The other group said, well,\n",
      "yes, sperm swim quickly\n",
      "12870.09 and even if they're released right at the entry\n",
      "12872.91 to the cervix that the sperm still have a long distance\n",
      "12876.58 to go.\n",
      "12877.08 Again, if you were to scale this according\n",
      "12879.36 to the size of the sperm versus the size of a human body,\n",
      "12882.57 an entire human body,\n",
      "what you'd scale it to\n",
      "12885.09 is the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n",
      "12887.34 And it needs to undergo that basically within 24 hours\n",
      "12889.77 or so.\n",
      "12890.04 Although, as we mentioned earlier,\n",
      "12891.457 sperm can survive quite a while inside\n",
      "12894.09 of the woman's body-- maybe three or five days at least.\n",
      "12897.85 So in both cases they acknowledge\n",
      "12899.245 it's a long distance.\n",
      "12900.12 But on the one hand,\n",
      "you have a group\n",
      "12901.83 of experts that are saying the sperm more or less know what\n",
      "12904.315 to do and are going to do it regardless\n",
      "12905.94 of the position of the woman after ejaculation inside her\n",
      "12909.06 and the other group saying, no, we\n",
      "12911.06 want to do everything we can to bias\n",
      "12912.6 the likelihood that the sperm will fertilize the egg.\n",
      "12916.17 Well, setting aside the basic argument\n",
      "12919.92 that tilting back at the pelvis and lying stationary or so\n",
      "12925.02 for about 15 minutes after sexual intercourse\n",
      "12928.35 and ejaculation is not an expensive endeavor,\n",
      "12933.69 although it requires a little bit of time.\n",
      "12936.21 And it forces people to remain motionless or close\n",
      "12939.42 to motionless, and they're not up and around and moving about.\n",
      "12942.69 Aside from that, it's a relatively low investment.\n",
      "12945.4 So one argument is,\n",
      "well, if it could\n",
      "12947.43 bias the likelihood of fertilization at all\n",
      "12950.82 and people want to get pregnant,\n",
      "why wouldn't they do that?\n",
      "12954.807 So that's a reasonable argument.\n",
      "12956.14 But it doesn't really point to the mechanism.\n",
      "12958.41 The arguments that point to a potential mechanism are that--\n",
      "12961.518 if you recall what we were talking about when we talked\n",
      "12963.81 about sperm quality,\n",
      "sperm quality\n",
      "12966.055 involves a bunch of different measures,\n",
      "12967.68 like concentration of sperm per milliliter of semen,\n",
      "12971.25 morphology of those sperm,\n",
      "how many are forward motile.\n",
      "12974.61 It turns out that in any one ejaculate sample,\n",
      "12977.88 the total number of forward motile and yet fast forward\n",
      "12982.71 motile sperm that are also of the highest quality morphology\n",
      "12988.59 is actually quite low.\n",
      "12990.37 And so the idea here is that you want\n",
      "12993.0 to get as many sperm of the highest quality\n",
      "12995.73 swimming toward the egg because those sperm stand the highest\n",
      "12999.03 probability of fertilizing that egg.\n",
      "13000.682 And in fact, this relates to some of the discussion we were\n",
      "13003.14 having earlier about behavioral dos and don'ts for sake\n",
      "13006.89 of increasing the probability of fertilization.\n",
      "13010.4 And the one that is most important here is cannabis.\n",
      "13013.91 It turns out that the data on cannabis\n",
      "13015.74 really do support the idea that some of you\n",
      "13018.5 may have heard from parents and teachers--\n",
      "13020.93 I don't know, I did hear this from parents and teachers--\n",
      "13023.72 that cannabis can disrupt the swimming styles of sperm\n",
      "13028.7 in ways that are not supportive of fertilization,\n",
      "13031.82 that it can turn more of the sperm into twitchers.\n",
      "13034.1 Although when I learned about this,\n",
      "13035.21 I was not informed of the word \"twitchers.\"\n",
      "13037.002 What I was told is that,\n",
      "if you use cannabis,\n",
      "13040.1 that the sperm don't know which direction to go,\n",
      "13042.44 that they're confused,\n",
      "almost implying\n",
      "13045.2 that the sperm themselves are high on cannabis.\n",
      "13047.87 Well, that's certainly not the argument that I'm making here.\n",
      "13051.35 But it does seem to be the case that people\n",
      "13054.26 who use cannabis, even once,\n",
      "the sperm that are generated\n",
      "13058.63 during that particular month or two months during which\n",
      "13063.7 or after which they use cannabis have\n",
      "13066.19 less forward motility and possibly altered morphology,\n",
      "13070.87 as well.\n",
      "13071.56 I want to be very clear, I did not\n",
      "13073.12 say that if you use cannabis once you are forever\n",
      "13075.79 disrupting the motility and morphology of your sperm.\n",
      "13079.36 I did not say that.\n",
      "13080.17 What I said is that if you use cannabis once,\n",
      "13082.75 then the sperm that are generated in the 60 days\n",
      "13085.96 after that cannabis use are going\n",
      "13089.13 to have a higher incidence of disrupted motility and perhaps\n",
      "13092.83 morphology as well.\n",
      "13094.84 Remember, sperm are continually generated every 60 days or so.\n",
      "13099.9 And so if you use cannabis once, you are not forever\n",
      "13103.26 disrupting your sperm.\n",
      "13104.28 But if you are using cannabis and then you\n",
      "13106.53 are looking to conceive in the next 60 days,\n",
      "13108.87 you are going to be reducing,\n",
      "we think significantly so,\n",
      "13112.95 the number of quality forwardly motile sperm.\n",
      "13116.74 So the simple takeaway from this is avoid cannabis use.\n",
      "13119.52 Although if you are going to use cannabis-- and again,\n",
      "13121.95 there are medical uses of cannabis\n",
      "13124.17 and beneficial uses of cannabis for certain populations.\n",
      "13126.6 It can be bad for other populations.\n",

      "13147.0 of fertilization and pregnancy.\n",
      "13148.59 And I want to couch this whole discussion around cannabis\n",
      "13151.052 under the umbrella of something that came up in the episode\n",
      "13153.51 that I did on cannabis,\n",
      "which is that, for about half\n",
      "13156.93 of people out there,\n",
      "male and female--\n",
      "13159.79 so here we're not distinguishing by biological sex.\n",
      "13163.71 About half of people that use cannabis\n",
      "13165.63 report it as an aphrodisiac.\n",
      "13167.34 It makes them want to have sexual intercourse more than\n",
      "13170.595 if they don't use cannabis.\n",
      "13171.72 And for the other half, it actually\n",
      "13173.64 has the opposite effect by way of an influence on a hormone\n",
      "13176.49 called prolactin,\n",
      "which suppresses\n",
      "13178.5 the dopamine system,\n",
      "the testosterone,\n",
      "13180.24 and the estrogenic system.\n",
      "13182.29 And so this whole idea that cannabis is an aphrodisiac\n",
      "13185.19 seems to be true for about half of the human population and not\n",
      "13188.25 for the other half of the human population.\n",
      "13190.06 So I mention that because I know a number of people\n",
      "13192.66 use cannabis as an aphrodisiac.\n",
      "13195.72 They like to use cannabis before intercourse.\n",
      "13197.61 It was actually very surprising to me\n",
      "13200.07 to discover when I researched that cannabis\n",
      "13202.2 episode that approximately\n",
      "15% of women who are pregnant\n",
      "13207.66 continue to use cannabis during pregnancy.\n",
      "13210.51 And that's a very alarming statistic.\n",
      "13212.7 And everything we know is that the use of cannabis\n",
      "13216.33 during pregnancy is detrimental to the health and particularly\n",
      "13219.6 the brain development of the fetus.\n",
      "13221.35 So that's a real concern.\n",
      "13223.17 I highly recommend women abstain from cannabis use\n",
      "13225.93 during pregnancy.\n",
      "13227.49 Talk to your OB/GYN about it if you're using it all\n",
      "13230.25 or considering using at all.\n",
      "13231.63 So based on what I told you earlier about the fact\n",
      "13233.79 that cannabis use is not good for egg quality and the fact\n",
      "13238.23 that cannabis use can disrupt the motility of sperm\n",
      "13240.93 and therefore is not good for sperm quality\n",
      "13244.17 and it can disrupt the patterns of swimming in sperm in ways\n",
      "13247.74 that reduce the likelihood of fertility,\n",
      "13249.942 I think the take-home message is clear, which is that\n",
      "13252.15 whether or not you want to be a cannabis user\n",
      "13255.03 or not, if you are going to try and conceive\n",
      "13257.22 and certainly while you're pregnant,\n",
      "13258.72 you're going to want to avoid the use of cannabis.\n",
      "13260.97 And that is smoked cannabis and vaped cannabis.\n",
      "13263.97 And during pregnancy,\n",
      "the consumption\n",
      "13267.39 of cannabis even in edible form or in tincture form\n",
      "13270.06 is also going to be detrimental to the developing fetus.\n",
      "13272.88 But of course, we started this conversation\n",
      "13275.07 in the context of body position, in particular\n",
      "13278.1 at the point of ejaculation, in determining\n",

      "13284.61 a successful fertilization in pregnancy.\n",
      "13286.75 And I think that given that the tilting back of the pelvis--\n",
      "13290.97 so again, this is elevating the pelvis by about 20 degrees--\n",
      "13294.33 I don't think it has to be exact, exact--\n",
      "13296.31 but about 20 degrees for about\n",
      "15 minutes post-ejaculation\n",
      "13300.12 inside of the woman-- or I suppose\n",
      "13302.4 if people are using IUI,\n",

      "13313.17 can be beneficial for increasing the probability\n",
      "13315.99 of fertilization and given that it involves\n",
      "13318.12 no cost but a little bit of time seems to me that,\n",
      "13320.557 if you want to get pregnant, that that\n",
      "13322.14 would be the right thing to do.\n",
      "13323.577 And as far as I know,\n",
      "there's no information\n",

      "13856.01 1 to 3 grams per day of capsule form L-carnitine\n",

      "13883.64 Now, the mechanism for that effect is pretty clear.\n",
      "13886.16 L-carnitine is involved in the processing of lipids, fats,\n",
      "13891.53 in terms of mitochondrial function.\n",
      "13894.21 And as we talked about before, mitochondria\n",
      "13896.42 are vital for the organization and action of the spindle that\n",

      "13913.64 It's also involved in the actual fusion of the egg\n",
      "13916.79 as it exits the ovary and enters the ovulation cycle.\n",
      "13921.022 Mitochondria are also important,\n",

      "13923.48 for the forward motility of sperm because\n",
      "13925.22 of the enrichment of mitochondria\n",

      "13932.93 as well as other aspects of cellular morphology.\n",
      "13935.31 So it makes a lot of sense as to why L-carnitine supplementation\n",
      "13938.847 would be beneficial.\n",
      "13939.68 Again, it's 1 to 3 grams per day over a period of about 30\n",

      "14003.82 offset the increase in TMAO.\n",
      "14006.01 But 600 milligram capsules of garlic are going to be--\n",
      "14009.55 or garlic extract, rather--\n",
      "14011.78 is going to be the most probably cost effective and simplest way\n",
      "14016.3 to do this.\n",
      "14017.17 And also, they are going to create that garlic smell.\n",
      "14019.388 Some people like the smell of garlic.\n",
      "14020.93 Some people don't.\n",
      "14021.68 So if you're going to take oral L-carnitine,\n",

      "you're going to want\n",
      "14402.11 to convert that to milligrams.\n",
      "14403.76 So let's say you're taking 2\n",
      "grams of myo-inositol per day.\n",
      "14407.18 That's 2,000 milligrams.\n",
      "14408.38 Then you'd want to divide that by 25.\n",
      "14410.75 And that's how many milligrams of D-chiro inositol\n",
      "14413.96 you would want to take, as well.\n",
      "14415.59 Or you could go with the lower end dose and divide it by 40\n",

      "14437.51 But none of these are prescription drugs.\n",
      "14439.218 And of course, you should always discuss any supplements\n",

      "14500.07 before on this podcast--\n",
      "14501.27 and many fertility docs will suggest--\n",
      "14503.31 that their patients take omega-3\n",
      "fatty acids in supplement form.\n",
      "14508.22 It could be taken in liquid form or in capsule form,\n",
      "14510.56 but enough of those that you're getting at least 1 gram per day\n",
      "14513.95 of the EPA form of omega-3,\n",
      "so at least 1 gram per day\n",
      "14517.82 and as high as 2 or even 3\n",
      "grams per day of the EPA form.\n",
      "14521.625 So you'll need to look at the packaging\n",
      "14523.25 because oftentimes it'll say high potency omega-3.\n",
      "14525.86 It'll say 1,500\n",

      "14530.06 But that's not 1,500\n",

      "14545.06 The most cost-effective way to do\n",
      "14546.47 that is going to be liquid-form omegas,\n",

      "14839.23 Shilajit stimulates the release of FSH.\n",

      "14888.65 I recommend starting with the lowest possible dosage.\n",

      "14896.79 and then increase the dosage as needed\n",

      "14927.44 as this black tar substance, contains\n",
      "14929.99 a lot of different things.\n",
      "14931.2 In fact, it comes from a mineral pitch.\n",
      "14933.14 What is that?\n",
      "14933.76 It comes from literally the dirt and plants\n",
      "14936.2 that have been compressed by rocks in the Himalayas.\n",

      "14940.622 comes down to it.\n",
      "14941.33 But the biological effects of Shilajit,\n",
      "14943.7 in both males and females,\n",
      "seem to be related to the fact\n",
      "14946.49 that it is highly enriched in something called folic acid,\n",
      "14949.46 and folic acid is involved in a lot\n",
      "14951.17 of different cellular processes,\n",
      "not the least of which,\n",
      "14953.78 at least in this context, is the transport of molecules\n",
      "14957.92 across cell membranes.\n",
      "14959.337 And for hormones to have their effect,\n",
      "14960.92 they need to cross cell membranes on the outside\n",
      "14962.92 and the inside of the cell.\n",
      "14964.588 So maybe that's how it's having its effect.\n",
      "14966.38 Again, the mechanisms of exactly how Shilajit increases\n",
      "14969.92 testosterone and FSH and thereby libido, egg quality,\n",
      "14973.31 and sperm quality aren't entirely clear.\n",

      "14982.43 it might be something to consider.\n",

      "14996.74 of zinc each day.\n",
      "14998.0 Males, on the other hand, seem to benefit\n",
      "15000.58 from having additionally high levels of zinc intake.\n",
      "15004.163 Now, that can be obtained through foods.\n",
      "15005.83 You often hear, oh, oysters are enriched in zinc,\n",
      "15008.62 and oysters are an aphrodisiac.\n",
      "15011.205 I don't know who's doing the marketing for oysters,\n",
      "15013.33 but it's really terrific.\n",
      "15015.08 I think that seems to have persisted.\n",
      "15016.69 And maybe it's true.\n",
      "15019.51 Oysters are enriched in zinc.\n",
      "15021.04 What does zinc do for fertility?\n",
      "15023.87 Well, in males, we know,\n",
      "based on a really nice set\n",
      "15026.74 of studies, that zinc dosages that\n",
      "15029.23 are pretty high of about 120 milligrams\n",
      "15031.72 taken twice per day--\n",
      "15033.73 that's quite a lot-- with meals can significantly\n",
      "15037.24 increase testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.\n",
      "15040.54 And this probably shouldn't come as a surprise to us.\n",
      "15042.86 It turns out that zinc is highly enriched in human testes\n",
      "15046.54 and in the testes of other animals,\n",
      "15048.2 including fish and other mammals.\n",
      "15049.72 And it was actually in 1921\n",
      "that it was observed in fish\n",

      "15058.54 during their breeding season.\n",

      "15065.77 It turns out that zinc in both animals,\n",

      "15075.55 including the function of androgen-binding protein.\n",
      "15078.8 So it seems that high levels of zinc\n",

      "15082.75 levels very significantly.\n",
      "15085.193 This was explored in a really nice study\n",

      "but there have been studies\n",
      "15101.41 subsequently that point to the fact that supplementation\n",
      "15103.81 with zinc at those high levels can really\n",

      "15115.75 zinc-- this 120 milligrams of zinc two times daily\n",
      "15119.225 definitely needs to be done with meals.\n",

      "15125.59 you can feel very nauseous,\n",
      "not well, for a few hours.\n",
      "15129.1 So make sure that you're taking zinc with full meals.\n",
      "15131.83 So this would mean that you're taking in at least\n",
      "15134.59 two full meals per day.\n",
